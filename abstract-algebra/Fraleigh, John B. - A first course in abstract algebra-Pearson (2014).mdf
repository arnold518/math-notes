## Section 0 Sets and Relations

## On Definitions, and the Notion of a Set

Many students do not realize the great importance of definitions to mathematics. This importance stems from the need for mathematicians to communicate with each other. If two people are trying to communicate about some subject, they must have the same understanding of its technical terms. However, there is an important structural weakness.

It is impossible to define every concept.

Suppose, for example, we define the term set as "A set is a well-defined collection of objects." One naturally asks what is meant by a collection. We could define it as "A collection is an aggregate of things." What, then, is an aggregate? Now our language is finite, so after some time we will run out of new words to use and have to repeat some words already examined. The definition is then circular and obviously worthless. Mathematicians realize that there must be some undefined or primitive concept with which to start. At the moment, they have agreed that set shall be such a primitive concept. We shall not define set, but shall just hope that when such expressions as "the set of all real numbers" or "the set of all members of the United States Senate" are used, people's various ideas of what is meant are sufficiently similar to make communication feasible.

We summarize briefly some of the things we shall simply assume about sets.

1. A set $S$ is made up of elements, and if $a$ is one of these elements, we shall denote this fact by $a \in S$.
2. There is exactly one set with no elements. It is the empty set and is denoted by $\varnothing$.
3. We may describe a set either by giving a characterizing property of the elements, such as "the set of all members of the United States Senate," or by listing the elements. The standard way to describe a set by listing elements is to enclose the designations of the elements, separated by commas, in braces, for example, $\{1,2,15\}$. If a set is described by a characterizing property $P(x)$ of its elements $x$, the brace notation $\{x \mid P(x)\}$ is also often used, and is read "the set of all $x$ such that the statement $P(x)$ about $x$ is true." Thus

$$
\begin{aligned}
\{2,4,6,8\} & =\{x \mid x \text { is an even whole positive number } \leq 8\} \\
& =\{2 x \mid x=1,2,3,4\}
\end{aligned}
$$

The notation $\{x \mid P(x)\}$ is often called "set-builder notation."

4. A set is well defined, meaning that if $S$ is a set and $a$ is some object, then either $a$ is definitely in $S$, denoted by $a \in S$, or $a$ is definitely not in $S$, denoted by $a \notin S$. Thus, we should never say, "Consider the set $S$ of some positive numbers," for it is not definite whether $2 \in S$ or $2 \notin S$. On the other hand, we
can consider the set $T$ of all prime positive integers. Every positive integer is definitely either prime or not prime. Thus $5 \in T$ and $14 \notin T$. It may be hard to actually determine whether an object is in a set. For example, as this book goes to press it is probably unknown whether $2^{\left(2^{65}\right)}+1$ is in $T$. However, $2^{\left(2^{65}\right)}+1$ is certainly either prime or not prime.

It is not feasible for this text to push the definition of everything we use all the way back to the concept of a set. For example, we will never define the number $\pi$ in terms of a set.

Every definition is an if and only if type of statement.

With this understanding, definitions are often stated with the only if suppressed, but it is always to be understood as part of the definition. Thus we may define an isosceles triangle as follows: "A triangle is isosceles if it has two sides of equal length," when we really mean that a triangle is isosceles if and only if it has two sides of equal length.

In our text, we have to define many terms. We use specifically labeled and numbered definitions for the main algebraic concepts with which we are concerned. To avoid an overwhelming quantity of such labels and numberings, we define many terms within the body of the text and exercises using boldface type.

## Boldface Convention

A term printed in boldface in a sentence is being defined by that sentence.

Do not feel that you have to memorize a definition word for word. The important thing is to understand the concept, so that you can define precisely the same concept in your own words. Thus the definition "An isosceles triangle is one having two equal sides" is perfectly correct. Of course, we had to delay stating our boldface convention until we had finished using boldface in the preceding discussion of sets, because we do not define a set!

In this section, we do define some familiar concepts as sets, both for illustration and for review of the concepts. First we give a few definitions and some notation.

0.1 Definition $\quad$ A set $B$ is a subset of a set $A$, denoted by $B \subseteq A$ or $A \supseteq B$, if every element of $B$ is in $A$. The notations $B \subset A$ or $A \supset B$ will be used for $B \subseteq A$ but $B \neq A$.

Note that according to this definition, for any set $A, A$ itself and $\varnothing$ are both subsets of $A$.

0.2 Definition If $A$ is any set, then $A$ is the improper subset of $A$. Any other subset of $A$ is a proper subset of $A$.

0.3 Example Let $S=\{1,2,3\}$. This set $S$ has a total of eight subsets, namely $\emptyset,\{1\},\{2\},\{3\}$, $\{1,2\},\{1,3\},\{2,3\}$, and $\{1,2,3\}$.

0.4 Definition Let $A$ and $B$ be sets. The set $A \times B=\{(a, b) \mid a \in A$ and $b \in B\}$ is the Cartesian product of $A$ and $B$.

0.5 Example If $A=\{1,2,3\}$ and $B=\{3,4\}$, then we have

$$
A \times B=\{(1,3),(1,4),(2,3),(2,4),(3,3),(3,4)\}
$$

Throughout this text, much work will be done involving familiar sets of numbers. Let us take care of notation for these sets once and for all.

$\mathbb{Z}$ is the set of all integers (that is, whole numbers: positive, negative, and zero).

$\mathbb{Q}$ is the set of all rational numbers (that is, numbers that can be expressed as quotients $m / n$ of integers, where $n \neq 0$ ).

$\mathbb{R}$ is the set of all real numbers.

$\mathbb{Z}^{+}, \mathbb{Q}^{+}$, and $\mathbb{R}^{+}$are the sets of positive members of $\mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{Q}$, and $\mathbb{R}$, respectively.

$\mathbb{C}$ is the set of all complex numbers.

$\mathbb{Z}^{*}, \mathbb{Q}^{*}, \mathbb{R}^{*}$, and $\mathbb{C}^{*}$ are the sets of nonzero members of $\mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{Q}, \mathbb{R}$, and $\mathbb{C}$, respectively.

0.6 Example The set $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$ is the familiar Euclidean plane that we use in first-semester calculus to draw graphs of functions.

## Relations Between Sets

We introduce the notion of an element $a$ of set $A$ being related to an element $b$ of set $B$, which we might denote by $a \mathscr{R} b$. The notation $a \mathscr{R} b$ exhibits the elements $a$ and $b$ in left-to-right order, just as the notation $(a, b)$ for an element in $A \times B$. This leads us to the following definition of a relation $\mathscr{R}$ as a set.

0.7 Definition A relation between sets $A$ and $B$ is a subset $\mathscr{R}$ of $A \times B$. We read $(a, b) \in \mathscr{R}$ as " $a$ is related to $b$ " and write $a \mathscr{R} b$.

0.8 Example (Equality Relation) There is one familiar relation between a set and itself that we consider every set $S$ mentioned in this text to possess: namely, the equality relation $=$ defined on a set $S$ by

$$
=\text { is the subset }\{(x, x) \mid x \in S\} \text { of } S \times S \text {. }
$$

Thus for any $x \in S$, we have $x=x$, but if $x$ and $y$ are different elements of $S$, then $(x, y) \notin=$ and we write $x \neq y$.

We will refer to any relation between a set $S$ and itself, as in the preceding example, as a relation on $S$.

0.9 Example The graph of the function $f$ where $f(x)=x^{3}$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$, is the subset $\left\{\left(x, x^{3}\right) \mid x \in \mathbb{R}\right\}$ of $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$. Thus it is a relation on $\mathbb{R}$. The function is completely determined by its graph.

The preceding example suggests that rather than define a "function" $y=f(x)$ to be a "rule" that assigns to each $x \in \mathbb{R}$ exactly one $y \in \mathbb{R}$, we can easily describe it as a certain type of subset of $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$, that is, as a type of relation. We free ourselves from $\mathbb{R}$ and deal with any sets $X$ and $Y$.

0.10 Definition A function $\phi$ mapping $X$ into $Y$ is a relation between $X$ and $Y$ with the property that each $x \in X$ appears as the first member of exactly one ordered pair $(x, y)$ in $\phi$. Such a function is also called a map or mapping of $X$ into $Y$. We write $\phi: X \rightarrow Y$ and express $(x, y) \in \phi$ by $\phi(x)=y$. The domain of $\phi$ is the set $X$ and the set $Y$ is the codomain of $\phi$. The range of $\phi$ is $\phi[X]=\{\phi(x) \mid x \in X\}$.

0.11 Example We can view the addition of real numbers as a function $+:(\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}) \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, that is, as a mapping of $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$ into $\mathbb{R}$. For example, the action of + on $(2,3) \in \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$ is given in function notation by $+((2,3))=5$. In set notation we write $((2,3), 5) \in+$. Of course our familiar notation is $2+3=5$.

## Cardinality

The number of elements in a set $X$ is the cardinality of $X$ and is often denoted by $|X|$. For example, we have $|\{2,5,7\}|=3$. It will be important for us to know whether two sets have the same cardinality. If both sets are finite there is no problem; we can simply count the elements in each set. But do $\mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{Q}$, and $\mathbb{R}$ have the same cardinality? To convince ourselves that two sets $X$ and $Y$ have the same cardinality, we try to exhibit a pairing of each $x$ in $X$ with only one $y$ in $Y$ in such a way that each element of $Y$ is also used only once in this pairing. For the sets $X=\{2,5,7\}$ and $Y=\{?, !$,\#\}, the pairing

$$
2 \leftrightarrow ?, \quad 5 \leftrightarrow \#, \quad 7 \leftrightarrow !
$$

shows they have the same cardinality. Notice that we could also exhibit this pairing as $\{(2, ?),(5, \#),(7, !)\}$ which, as a subset of $X \times Y$, is a relation between $X$ and $Y$. The pairing

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | $\cdots$ |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| $\uparrow$ | $\uparrow$ | $\uparrow$ | $\uparrow$ | $\uparrow$ | $\uparrow$ | $\uparrow$ | $\uparrow$ | $\uparrow$ | $\uparrow$ |  |
| 0 | -1 | 1 | -2 | 2 | -3 | 3 | -4 | 4 | -5 | $\ldots$ |

shows that the sets $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Z}^{+}$have the same cardinality. Such a pairing, showing that sets $X$ and $Y$ have the same cardinality, is a special type of relation $\leftrightarrow$ between $X$ and $Y$ called a one-to-one correspondence. Since each element $x$ of $X$ appears precisely once in this relation, we can regard this one-to-one correspondence as a function with domain $X$. The range of the function is $Y$ because each $y$ in $Y$ also appears in some pairing $x \leftrightarrow y$. We formalize this discussion in a definition.

0.12 Definition $\quad{ }^{*} \mathrm{~A}$ function $\phi: X \rightarrow Y$ is one to one if $\phi\left(x_{1}\right)=\phi\left(x_{2}\right)$ only when $x_{1}=x_{2}$ (see Exercise 37). The function $\phi$ is onto $Y$ if the range of $\phi$ is $Y$.[^0]

If a subset of $X \times Y$ is a one-to-one function $\phi$ mapping $X$ onto $Y$, then each $x \in X$ appears as the first member of exactly one ordered pair in $\phi$ and also each $y \in Y$ appears as the second member of exactly one ordered pair in $\phi$. Thus if we interchange the first and second members of all ordered pairs $(x, y)$ in $\phi$ to obtain a set of ordered pairs $(y, x)$, we get a subset of $Y \times X$, which gives a one-to-one function mapping $Y$ onto $X$. This function is called the inverse function of $\phi$, and is denoted by $\phi^{-1}$. Summarizing, if $\phi$ maps $X$ one to one onto $Y$ and $\phi(x)=y$, then $\phi^{-1}$ maps $Y$ one to one onto $X$, and $\phi^{-1}(y)=x$.

0.13 Definition Two sets $X$ and $Y$ have the same cardinality if there exists a one-to-one function mapping $X$ onto $Y$, that is, if there exists a one-to-one correspondence between $X$ and $Y$.

0.14 Example The function $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ where $f(x)=x^{2}$ is not one to one because $f(2)=f(-2)=4$ but $2 \neq-2$. Also, it is not onto $\mathbb{R}$ because the range is the proper subset of all nonnegative numbers in $\mathbb{R}$. However, $g: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ defined by $g(x)=x^{3}$ is both one to one and onto $\mathbb{R}$.

We showed that $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Z}^{+}$have the same cardinality. We denote this cardinal number by $\aleph_{0}$, so that $|\mathbb{Z}|=\left|\mathbb{Z}^{+}\right|=\aleph_{0}$. It is fascinating that a proper subset of an infinite set may have the same number of elements as the whole set; an infinite set can be defined as a set having this property.

We naturally wonder whether all infinite sets have the same cardinality as the set $\mathbb{Z}$. A set has cardinality $\aleph_{0}$ if and only if all of its elements could be listed in an infinite row, so that we could "number them" using $\mathbb{Z}^{+}$. Figure 0.15 indicates that this is possible for the set $\mathbb{Q}$. The square array of fractions extends infinitely to the right and infinitely downward, and contains all members of $\mathbb{Q}$. We have shown a string winding its way through this array. Imagine the fractions to be glued to this string. Taking the beginning of the string and pulling to the left in the direction of the arrow, the string straightens out and all elements of $\mathbb{Q}$ appear on it in an infinite row as $0, \frac{1}{2},-\frac{1}{2}, 1,-1, \frac{3}{2}, \cdots$. Thus $|\mathbb{Q}|=\aleph_{0}$ also.

0.15 Figure

If the set $S=\{x \in \mathbb{R} \mid 0<x<1\}$ has cardinality $\aleph_{0}$, all its elements could be listed as unending decimals in a column extending infinitely downward, perhaps as

$$
\begin{aligned}
& 0.3659663426 \cdots \\
& 0.7103958453 \cdots \\
& 0.0358493553 \cdots \\
& 0.9968452214 \cdots
\end{aligned}
$$

We now argue that any such array must omit some number in $S$. Surely $S$ contains a number $r$ having as its $n$th digit after the decimal point a number different from 0 , from 9 , and from the $n$th digit of the $n$th number in this list. For example, $r$ might start . $5637 \cdots$. The 5 rather than 3 after the decimal point shows $r$ cannot be the first number in $S$ listed in the array shown. The 6 rather than 1 in the second digit shows $r$ cannot be the second number listed, and so on. Because we could make this argument with any list, we see that $S$ has too many elements to be paired with those in $\mathbb{Z}^{+}$. Exercise 15 indicates that $\mathbb{R}$ has the same number of elements as $S$. We just denote the cardinality of $\mathbb{R}$ by $|\mathbb{R}|$. Exercise 19 indicates that there are infinitely many different cardinal numbers even greater than $|\mathbb{R}|$.

## Partitions and Equivalence Relations

Sets are disjoint if no two of them have any element in common. Later we will have occasion to break up a set having an algebraic structure (e.g., a notion of addition) into disjoint subsets that become elements in a related algebraic structure. We conclude this section with a study of such breakups, or partitions of sets.

0.16 Definition A partition of a set $S$ is a collection of nonempty subsets of $S$ such that every element of $S$ is in exactly one of the subsets. The subsets are the cells of the partition.

When discussing a partition of a set $S$, we denote by $\bar{x}$ the cell containing the element $x$ of $S$.

0.17 Example Splitting $\mathbb{Z}^{+}$into the subset of even positive integers (those divisible by 2 ) and the subset of odd positive integers (those leaving a remainder of 1 when divided by 2 ), we obtain a partition of $\mathbb{Z}^{+}$into two cells. For example, we can write

$$
\overline{14}=\{2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18, \cdots\}
$$

We could also partition $\mathbb{Z}^{+}$into three cells, one consisting of the positive integers divisible by 3 , another containing all positive integers leaving a remainder of 1 when divided by 3 , and the last containing positive integers leaving a remainder of 2 when divided by 3 .

Generalizing, for each positive integer $n$, we can partition $\mathbb{Z}^{+}$into $n$ cells according to whether the remainder is $0,1,2, \cdots, n-1$ when a positive integer is divided by $n$. These cells are the residue classes modulo $n$ in $\mathbb{Z}^{+}$. Exercise 35 asks us to display these partitions for the cases $n=2,3$, and 5 .

Each partition of a set $S$ yields a relation $\mathscr{R}$ on $S$ in a natural way: namely, for $x, y \in S$, let $x \mathscr{R} y$ if and only if $x$ and $y$ are in the same cell of the partition. In set notation, we would write $x \mathscr{R} y$ as $(x, y) \in \mathscr{R}$ (see Definition 0.7). A bit of thought shows that this relation $\mathscr{R}$ on $S$ satisfies the three properties of an equivalence relation in the following definition.

0.18 Definition An equivalence relation $\mathscr{R}$ on a set $S$ is one that satisfies these three properties for all $x, y, z \in S$.

1. (Reflexive) $x \mathscr{R} x$.
2. (Symmetric) If $x \mathscr{R} y$, then $y \mathscr{R} x$.
3. $\quad$ (Transitive) If $x \mathscr{R} y$ and $y \mathscr{R} z$ then $x \mathscr{R} z$.

To illustrate why the relation $\mathscr{R}$ corresponding to a partition of $S$ satisfies the symmetric condition in the definition, we need only observe that if $y$ is in the same cell as $x$ (that is, if $x \mathscr{R} y$ ), then $x$ is in the same cell as $y$ (that is, $y \mathscr{R} x$ ). We leave the similar observations to verify the reflexive and transitive properties to Exercise 28.

0.19 Example For any nonempty set $S$, the equality relation = defined by the subset $\{(x, x) \mid x \in S\}$ of $S \times S$ is an equivalence relation.

0.20 Example (Congruence Modulo $\boldsymbol{n}$ ) Let $n \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}$. The equivalence relation on $\mathbb{Z}^{+}$corresponding to the partition of $\mathbb{Z}^{+}$into residue classes modulo $n$, discussed in Example 0.17, is congruence modulo $n$. It is sometimes denoted by $\equiv_{n}$. Rather than write $a \equiv_{n} b$, we usually write $a \equiv b(\bmod n)$, read, " $a$ is congruent to $b$ modulo $n$." For example, we have $15 \equiv 27(\bmod 4)$ because both 15 and 27 have remainder 3 when divided by 4 .

0.21 Example Let a relation $\mathscr{R}$ on the set $\mathbb{Z}$ be defined by $n \mathscr{R} m$ if and only if $n m \geq 0$, and let us determine whether $\mathscr{R}$ is an equivalence relation.

Reflexive $a \mathscr{R} a$, because $a^{2} \geq 0$ for all $a \in \mathbb{Z}$.

Symmetric $\quad$ If $a \mathscr{R} b$, then $a b \geq 0$, so $b a \geq 0$ and $b \mathscr{R} a$.

Transitive If $a \mathscr{R} b$ and $b \mathscr{R} c$, then $a b \geq 0$ and $b c \geq 0$. Thus $a b^{2} c=a c b^{2} \geq 0$. If we knew $b^{2}>0$, we could deduce $a c \geq 0$ whence $a \mathscr{R} c$. We have to examine the case $b=0$ separately. A moment of thought shows that $-3 \mathscr{R} 0$ and $0 \mathscr{R} 5$, but we do not have $-3 \mathscr{R} 5$. Thus the relation $\mathscr{R}$ is not transitive, and hence is not an equivalence relation.

We observed above that a partition yields a natural equivalence relation. We now show that an equivalence relation on a set yields a natural partition of the set. The theorem that follows states both results for reference.

0.22 Theorem (Equivalence Relations and Partitions) Let $S$ be a nonempty set and let $\sim$ be an equivalence relation on $S$. Then $\sim$ yields a partition of $S$, where

$$
\bar{a}=\{x \in S \mid x \sim a\} .
$$

Also, each partition of $S$ gives rise to an equivalence relation $\sim$ on $S$ where $a \sim b$ if and only if $a$ and $b$ are in the same cell of the partition.

Proof We must show that the different cells $\bar{a}=\{x \in S \mid x \sim a\}$ for $a \in S$ do give a partition of $S$, so that every element of $S$ is in some cell and so that if $a \in \bar{b}$, then $\bar{a}=\bar{b}$. Let $a \in S$. Then $a \in \bar{a}$ by the reflexive condition (1), so $a$ is in at least one cell.

Suppose now that $a$ were in a cell $\bar{b}$ also. We need to show that $\bar{a}=\bar{b}$ as sets; this will show that $a$ cannot be in more than one cell. There is a standard way to show that two sets are the same:

## Show that each set is a subset of the other.

We show that $\bar{a} \subseteq \bar{b}$. Let $x \in \bar{a}$. Then $x \sim a$. But $a \in \bar{b}$, so $a \sim b$. Then, by the transitive condition (3), $x \sim b$, so $x \in \bar{b}$. Thus $\bar{a} \subseteq \bar{b}$. Now we show that $\bar{b} \subseteq \bar{a}$. Let $y \in \bar{b}$. Then $y \sim b$. But $a \in \bar{b}$, so $a \sim b$ and, by symmetry (2), $b \sim a$. Then by transitivity (3), $y \sim a$, so $y \in \bar{a}$. Hence $\bar{b} \subseteq \bar{a}$ also, so $\bar{b}=\bar{a}$ and our proof is complete.

Each cell in the partition arising from an equivalence relation is an equivalence class.

14. Recall that for $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ and $a<b$, the closed interval $[a, b]$ in $\mathbb{R}$ is defined by $[a, b]=\{x \in \mathbb{R} \mid a \leq x \leq b\}$.

For any set $A$, we denote by $\mathscr{P}(A)$ the collection of all subsets of $A$. For example, if $A=\{a, b, c, d\}$, then $\{a, b, d\} \in \mathscr{P}(A)$. The set $\mathscr{P}(A)$ is the power set of $A$. Exercises 16 through 19 deal with the notion of the power set of a set $A$.

18. For any set $A$, finite or infinite, let $B^{A}$ be the set of all functions mapping $A$ into the set $B=\{0,1\}$. Show that the cardinality of $B^{A}$ is the same as the cardinality of the set $\mathscr{P}(A)$. [Hint: Each element of $B^{A}$ determines a subset of $A$ in a natural way.]
19. Show that the power set of a set $A$, finite or infinite, has too many elements to be able to be put in a one-to-one correspondence with $A$. Explain why this intuitively means that there are an infinite number of infinite cardinal numbers. [Hint: Imagine a one-to-one function $\phi$ mapping $A$ into $\mathscr{P}(A)$ to be given. Show that $\phi$ cannot be onto $\mathscr{P}(A)$ by considering, for each $x \in A$, whether $x \in \phi(x)$ and using this idea to define a subset $S$ of $A$ that is not in the range of $\phi$.] Is the set of everything a logically acceptable concept?

21. How many numbers in the interval $0 \leq x \leq 1$ can be expressed in the form .\#\#, where each \# is a digit $0,1,2,3, \cdots, 9$ ? How many are there of the form .\#\#\#\#\#? Following this idea, and Exercise 15, decide what you would consider to be the value of $10^{\aleph_{0}}$. How about $12^{\aleph_{0}}$ and $2^{\aleph_{0}}$ ?
22. Continuing the idea in the preceding exercise and using Exercises 18 and 19 , use exponential notation to fill in the three blanks to give a list of five cardinal numbers, each of which is greater than the preceding one.

## Section 0 Sets and Relations

In Exercises 23 through 27, find the number of different partitions of a set having the given number of elements.
23. 1 element
24. 2 elements
25. 3 elements
26. 4 elements
27. 5 elements

28. Consider a partition of a set $S$. The paragraph following Definition 0.18 explained why the relation

$$
x \mathscr{R} y \text { if and only if } x \text { and } y \text { are in the same cell }
$$

satisfies the symmetric condition for an equivalence relation. Write similar explanations of why the reflexive and transitive properties are also satisifed.

In Exercises 29 through 34, determine whether the given relation is an equivalence relation on the set. Describe the partition arising from each equivalence relation.
29. $n \mathscr{R} m$ in $\mathbb{Z}$ if $n m>0$
30. $x \mathscr{R} y$ in $\mathbb{R}$ if $x \geq y$
31. $x \mathscr{R} y$ in $\mathbb{R}$ if $|x|=|y|$
32. $x \mathscr{R} y$ in $\mathbb{R}$ if $|x-y| \leq 3$
33. $n \mathscr{R} m$ in $\mathbb{Z}^{+}$if $n$ and $m$ have the same number of digits in the usual base ten notation
34. $n \mathscr{R} m$ in $\mathbb{Z}^{+}$if $n$ and $m$ have the same final digit in the usual base ten notation

35. Using set notation of the form $\{\#, \#, \#, \cdots\}$ for an infinite set, write the residue classes modulo $n$ in $\mathbb{Z}^{+}$discussed in Example 0.17 for the indicated value of $n$.
a. $n=2$
b. $n=3$
c. $n=5$
36. Let $n \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}$and let $\sim$ be defined on $\mathbb{Z}$ by $r \sim s$ if and only if $r-s$ is divisible by $n$, that is, if and only if $r-s=n q$ for some $q \in \mathbb{Z}$.

a. Show that $\sim$ is an equivalence relation on $\mathbb{Z}$. (It is called "congruence modulo $n$ " just as it was for $\mathbb{Z}^{+}$. See part b.)

b. Show that, when restricted to the subset $\mathbb{Z}^{+}$of $\mathbb{Z}$, this $\sim$ is the equivalence relation, congruence modulo $n$, of Example 0.20.

c. The cells of this partition of $\mathbb{Z}$ are residue classes modulo $n$ in $\mathbb{Z}$. Repeat Exercise 35 for the residue classes modulo $n$ in $\mathbb{Z}$ rather than in $\mathbb{Z}^{+}$using the notation $\{\cdots, \#, \#, \#, \cdots\}$ for these infinite sets.

37. Students often misunderstand the concept of a one-to-one function (mapping). I think I know the reason. You see, a mapping $\phi: A \rightarrow B$ has a direction associated with it, from $A$ to $B$. It seems reasonable to expect a one-to-one mapping simply to be a mapping that carries one point of $A$ into one point of $B$, in the direction indicated by the arrow. But of course, every mapping of $A$ into $B$ does this, and Definition 0.12 did not say that at all. With this unfortunate situation in mind, make as good a pedagogical case as you can for calling the functions described in Definition 0.12 two-to-two functions instead. (Unfortunately, it is almost impossible to get widely used terminology changed.)

## SECTION 1 Introduction and Examples

In this section, we attempt to give you a little idea of the nature of abstract algebra. We are all familiar with addition and multiplication of real numbers. Both addition and multiplication combine two numbers to obtain one number. For example, addition combines 2 and 3 to obtain 5. We consider addition and multiplication to be binary operations. In this text, we abstract this notion, and examine sets in which we have one or more binary operations. We think of a binary operation on a set as giving an algebra on the set, and we are interested in the structural properties of that algebra. To illustrate what we mean by a structural property with our familiar set $\mathbb{R}$ of real numbers, note that the equation $x+x=a$ has a solution $x$ in $\mathbb{R}$ for each $a \in \mathbb{R}$, namely, $x=a / 2$. However, the corresponding multiplicative equation $x \cdot x=a$ does not have a solution in $\mathbb{R}$ if $a<0$. Thus, $\mathbb{R}$ with addition has a different algebraic structure than $\mathbb{R}$ with multiplication.

Sometimes two different sets with what we naturally regard as very different binary operations turn out to have the same algebraic structure. For example, we will see in Section 3 that the set $\mathbb{R}$ with addition has the same algebraic structure as the set $\mathbb{R}^{+}$of positive real numbers with multiplication!

This section is designed to get you thinking about such things informally. We will make everything precise in Sections 2 and 3. We now turn to some examples. Multiplication of complex numbers of magnitude 1 provides us with several examples that will be useful and illuminating in our work. We start with a review of complex numbers and their multiplication.

## Complex Numbers

A real number can be visualized geometrically as a point on a line that we often regard as an $x$-axis. A complex number can be regarded as a point in the Euclidean plane, as shown in Fig. 1.1. Note that we label the vertical axis as the $y i$-axis rather than just the $y$-axis, and label the point one unit above the origin with $i$ rather than 1 . The point with Cartesian coordinates $(a, b)$ is labeled $a+b i$ in Fig. 1.1. The set $\mathbb{C}$ of complex numbers is defined by

$$
\mathbb{C}=\{a+b i \mid a, b \in \mathbb{R}\}
$$

We consider $\mathbb{R}$ to be a subset of the complex numbers by identifying a real number $r$ with the complex number $r+0 i$. For example, we write $3+0 i$ as 3 and $-\pi+0 i$ as $-\pi$ and $0+0 i$ as 0 . Similarly, we write $0+1 i$ as $i$ and $0+s i$ as $s i$.

Complex numbers were developed after the development of real numbers. The complex number $i$ was invented to provide a solution to the quadratic equation $x^{2}=-1$, so we require that

$$
i^{2}=-1 \text {. }
$$

Unfortunately, $i$ has been called an imaginary number, and this terminology has led generations of students to view the complex numbers with more skepticism than the real numbers. Actually, all numbers, such as $1,3, \pi,-\sqrt{3}$, and $i$ are inventions of our minds. There is no physical entity that is the number 1 . If there were, it would surely be in a place of honor in some great scientific museum, and past it would file a steady stream of mathematicians, gazing at 1 in wonder and awe. A basic goal of this text is to show how we can invent solutions of polynomial equations when the coefficients of the polynomial may not even be real numbers!

## Multiplication of Complex Numbers

The product $(a+b i)(c+d i)$ is defined in the way it must be if we are to enjoy the familiar properties of real arithmetic and require that $i^{2}=-1$, in accord with Eq. (1).

Namely, we see that we want to have

$$
\begin{aligned}
(a+b i)(c+d i) & =a c+a d i+b c i+b d i^{2} \\
& =a c+a d i+b c i+b d(-1) \\
& =(a c-b d)+(a d+b c) i
\end{aligned}
$$

Consequently, we define multiplication of $z_{1}=a+b i$ and $z_{2}=c+d i$ as

$$
z_{1} z_{2}=(a+b i)(c+d i)=(a c-b d)+(a d+b c) i
$$

which is of the form $r+s i$ with $r=a c-b d$ and $s=a d+b c$. It is routine to check that the usual properties $z_{1} z_{2}=z_{2} z_{1}, z_{1}\left(z_{2} z_{3}\right)=\left(z_{1} z_{2}\right) z_{3}$ and $z_{1}\left(z_{2}+z_{3}\right)=z_{1} z_{2}+z_{1} z_{3}$ all hold for all $z_{1}, z_{2}, z_{3} \in \mathbb{C}$.

1.2 Example Compute $(2-5 i)(8+3 i)$.

Solution We don't memorize Eq. (2), but rather we compute the product as we did to motivate that equation. We have

$$
(2-5 i)(8+3 i)=16+6 i-40 i+15=31-34 i \text {. }
$$

To establish the geometric meaning of complex multiplication, we first define the absolute value $|a+b i|$ of $a+b i$ by

$$
|a+b i|=\sqrt{a^{2}+b^{2}} .
$$

This absolute value is a nonnegative real number and is the distance from $a+b i$ to the origin in Fig. 1.1. We can now describe a complex number $z$ in the polar-coordinate form

$$
z=|z|(\cos \theta+i \sin \theta)
$$

where $\theta$ is the angle measured counterclockwise from the $x$-axis to the vector from 0 to $z$, as shown in Fig. 1.3. A famous formula due to Leonard Euler states that

$$
e^{i \theta}=\cos \theta+i \sin \theta
$$

## Euler's Formula

We ask you to derive Euler's formula formally from the power series expansions for $e^{\theta}, \cos \theta$ and $\sin \theta$ in Exercise 41. Using this formula, we can express $z$ in Eq. (4) as

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_01_27_9289ad7bed1dd2e5e553g-018.jpg?height=341&width=531&top_left_y=1971&top_left_x=992)

1.3 Figure

Part I Groups and Subgroups

$z=|z| e^{i \theta}$. Let us set

$$
z_{1}=\left|z_{1}\right| e^{i \theta_{1}} \quad \text { and } \quad z_{2}=\left|z_{2}\right| e^{i \theta_{2}}
$$

and compute their product in this form, assuming that the usual laws of exponentiation hold with complex number exponents. We obtain

$$
\begin{aligned}
z_{1} z_{2} & =\left|z_{1}\right| e^{i \theta_{1}}\left|z_{2}\right| e^{i \theta_{2}}=\left|z_{1}\right|\left|z_{2}\right| e^{i\left(\theta_{1}+\theta_{2}\right)} \\
& =\left|z_{1}\right|\left|z_{2}\right|\left[\cos \left(\theta_{1}+\theta_{2}\right)+i \sin \left(\theta_{1}+\theta_{2}\right)\right]
\end{aligned}
$$

Note that Eq. 5 concludes in the polar form of Eq. 4 where $\left|z_{1} z_{2}\right|=\left|z_{1}\right|\left|z_{2}\right|$ and the polar angle $\theta$ for $z_{1} z_{2}$ is the sum $\theta=\theta_{1}+\theta_{2}$. Thus, geometrically, we multiply complex numbers by multiplying their absolute values and adding their polar angles, as shown in Fig. 1.4. Exercise 39 indicates how this can be derived via trigonometric identities without recourse to Euler's formula and assumptions about complex exponentiation.

1.5 Figure

Note that $i$ has polar angle $\pi / 2$ and absolute value 1, as shown in Fig. 1.5. Thus $i^{2}$ has polar angle $2(\pi / 2)=\pi$ and $|1 \cdot 1|=1$, so that $i^{2}=-1$.

1.6 Example Find all solutions in $\mathbb{C}$ of the equation $z^{2}=i$.

Solution Writing the equation $z^{2}=i$ in polar form and using Eq. (5), we obtain

$$
|z|^{2}(\cos 2 \theta+i \sin 2 \theta)=1(0+i) .
$$

Thus $|z|^{2}=1$, so $|z|=1$. The angle $\theta$ for $z$ must satisfy $\cos 2 \theta=0$ and $\sin 2 \theta=1$. Consequently, $2 \theta=(\pi / 2)+n(2 \pi)$, so $\theta=(\pi / 4)+n \pi$ for an integer $n$. The values of $n$ yielding values $\theta$ where $0 \leq \theta<2 \pi$ are 0 and 1 , yielding $\theta=\pi / 4$ or $\theta=5 \pi / 4$. Our solutions are

$$
z_{1}=1\left(\cos \frac{\pi}{4}+i \sin \frac{\pi}{4}\right) \quad \text { and } \quad z_{2}=1\left(\cos \frac{5 \pi}{4}+i \sin \frac{5 \pi}{4}\right)
$$

or

$$
z_{1}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(1+i) \quad \text { and } \quad z_{2}=\frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}(1+i)
$$

1.7 Example Find all solutions of $z^{4}=-16$.

Solution As in Example 1.6 we write the equation in polar form, obtaining

$$
|z|^{4}(\cos 4 \theta+i \sin 4 \theta)=16(-1+0 i)
$$

Consequently, $|z|^{4}=16$, so $|z|=2$ while $\cos 4 \theta=-1$ and $\sin 4 \theta=0$. We find that $4 \theta=\pi+n(2 \pi)$, so $\theta=(\pi / 4)+n(\pi / 2)$ for integers $n$. The different values of $\theta$ obtained where $0 \leq \theta<2 \pi$ are $\pi / 4,3 \pi / 4,5 \pi / 4$, and $7 \pi / 4$. Thus one solution of $z^{4}=$ -16 is

$$
2\left(\cos \frac{\pi}{4}+i \sin \frac{\pi}{4}\right)=2\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} i\right)=\sqrt{2}(1+i)
$$

In a similar way, we find three more solutions,

$$
\sqrt{2}(-1+i), \quad \sqrt{2}(-1-i), \quad \text { and } \quad \sqrt{2}(1-i) \text {. }
$$

The last two examples illustrate that we can find solutions of an equation $z^{n}=a+b i$ by writing the equation in polar form. There will always be $n$ solutions, provided that $a+b i \neq 0$. Exercises 16 through 21 ask you to solve equations of this type.

We will not use addition or division of complex numbers, but we probably should mention that addition is given by

$$
(a+b i)+(c+d i)=(a+c)+(b+d) i
$$

and division of $a+b i$ by nonzero $c+d i$ can be performed using the device

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{a+b i}{c+d i} & =\frac{a+b i}{c+d i} \cdot \frac{c-d i}{c-d i}=\frac{(a c+b d)+(b c-a d) i}{c^{2}+d^{2}} \\
& =\frac{a c+b d}{c^{2}+d^{2}}+\frac{b c-a d}{c^{2}+d^{2}} i
\end{aligned}
$$

## Algebra on Circles

Let $U=\{z \in \mathbb{C}|| z \mid=1\}$, so that $U$ is the circle in the Euclidean plane with center at the origin and radius 1 , as shown in Fig. 1.8. The relation $\left|z_{1} z_{2}\right|=\left|z_{1}\right|\left|z_{2}\right|$ shows that the product of two numbers in $U$ is again a number in $U$; we say that $U$ is closed under multiplication. Thus, we can view multiplication in $U$ as providing algebra on the circle in Fig. 1.8.

As illustrated in Fig. 1.8, we associate with each $z=\cos \theta+i \sin \theta$ in $U$ a real number $\theta \in \mathbb{R}$ that lies in the half-open interval where $0 \leq \theta<2 \pi$. This half-open interval is usually denoted by $[0,2 \pi)$, but we prefer to denote it by $\mathbb{R}_{2 \pi}$ for reasons that will be apparent later. Recall that the angle associated with the product $z_{1} z_{2}$ of two complex numbers is the sum $\theta_{1}+\theta_{2}$ of the associated angles. Of course if $\theta_{1}+\theta_{2} \geq 2 \pi$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_01_27_9289ad7bed1dd2e5e553g-021.jpg?height=463&width=580&top_left_y=465&top_left_x=903)

1.8 Figure

then the angle in $\mathbb{R}_{2 \pi}$ associated with $z_{1} z_{2}$ is $\theta_{1}+\theta_{2}-2 \pi$. This gives us an addition modulo $2 \pi$ on $\mathbb{R}_{2 \pi}$. We denote this addition here by $+2 \pi$.

1.9 Example In $\mathbb{R}_{2 \pi}$, we have $\frac{3 \pi}{2}+2 \pi \frac{5 \pi}{4}=\frac{11 \pi}{4}-2 \pi=\frac{3 \pi}{4}$.

There was nothing special about the number $2 \pi$ that enabled us to define addition on the half-open interval $\mathbb{R}_{2 \pi}$. We can use any half-open interval $\mathbb{R}_{c}=\{x \in \mathbb{R} \mid 0 \leq x<c\}$.

1.10 Example $\quad$ In $\mathbb{R}_{23}$, we have $16+{ }_{23} 19=35-23=12$. In $\mathbb{R}_{8.5}$, we have $6+{ }_{8.5} 8=14-8.5=5.5$.

Now complex number multiplication on the circle $U$ where $|z|=1$ and addition modulo $2 \pi$ on $\mathbb{R}_{2 \pi}$ have the same algebraic properties. We have the natural one-to-one correspondence $z \leftrightarrow \theta$ between $z \in U$ and $\theta \in \mathbb{R}_{2 \pi}$ indicated in Fig. 1.8. Moreover, we deliberately defined $+_{2 \pi}$ so that

$$
\text { if } \begin{aligned}
z_{1} \leftrightarrow \theta_{1} \quad \text { and } \quad z_{2} \leftrightarrow \theta_{2}, \text { then } \quad z_{1} \cdot z_{2} \leftrightarrow\left(\theta_{1}+2 \pi \theta_{2}\right) \text {. } \\
\text { isomorphism }
\end{aligned}
$$

The relation (8) shows that if we rename each $z \in U$ by its corresponding angle $\theta$ shown in Fig. 1.8, then the product of two elements in $U$ is renamed by the sum of the angles for those two elements. Thus $U$ with complex number multiplication and $\mathbb{R}_{2 \pi}$ with addition modulo $2 \pi$ must have the same algebraic properties. They differ only in the names of the elements and the names of the operations. Such a one-to-one correspondence satisfying the relation (8) is called an isomorphism. Names of elements and names of binary operations are not important in abstract algebra; we are interested in algebraic
properties. We illustrate what we mean by saying that the algebraic properties of $U$ and of $\mathbb{R}_{2 \pi}$ are the same.

1.11 Example In $U$ there is exactly one element $e$ such that $e \cdot z=z$ for all $z \in U$, namely, $e=1$. The element 0 in $\mathbb{R}_{2 \pi}$ that corresponds to $1 \in U$ is the only element $e$ in $\mathbb{R}_{2 \pi}$ such that $e+2 \pi x=x$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}_{2 \pi}$.

1.12 Example The equation $z \cdot z \cdot z \cdot z=1$ in $U$ has exactly four solutions, namely, $1, i,-1$, and $-i$. Now $1 \in U$ and $0 \in \mathbb{R}_{2 \pi}$ correspond, and the equation $x+{ }_{2 \pi} x+{ }_{2 \pi} x+{ }_{2 \pi} x=0$ in $\mathbb{R}_{2 \pi}$ has exactly four solutions, namely, $0, \pi / 2, \pi$, and $3 \pi / 2$, which, of course, correspond to $1, i,-1$, and $-i$, respectively.

Because our circle $U$ has radius 1, it has circumference $2 \pi$ and the radian measure of an angle $\theta$ is equal to the length of the arc the angle subtends. If we pick up our half-open interval $\mathbb{R}_{2 \pi}$, put the 0 in the interval down on the 1 on the $x$-axis and wind it around the circle $U$ counterclockwise, it will reach all the way back to 1 . Moreover, each number in the interval will fall on the point of the circle having that number as the value of the central angle $\theta$ shown in Fig. 1.8. This shows that we could also think of addition on $\mathbb{R}_{2 \pi}$ as being computed by adding lengths of subtended arcs counterclockwise, starting at $z=1$, and subtracting $2 \pi$ if the sum of the lengths is $2 \pi$ or greater.

If we think of addition on a circle in terms of adding lengths of arcs from a starting point $P$ on the circle and proceeding counterclockwise, we can use a circle of radius 2 , which has circumference $4 \pi$, just as well as a circle of radius 1 . We can take our half-open interval $\mathbb{R}_{4 \pi}$ and wrap it around counterclockwise, starting at $P$; it will just cover the whole circle. Addition of arcs lengths gives us a notion of algebra for points on this circle of radius 2 , which is surely isomorphic to $\mathbb{R}_{4 \pi}$ with addition $+_{4 \pi}$. However, if we take as the circle $|z|=2$ in Fig. 1.8, multiplication of complex numbers does not give us an algebra on this circle. The relation $\left|z_{1} z_{2}\right|=\left|z_{1}\right|\left|z_{2}\right|$ shows that the product of two such complex numbers has absolute value 4 rather than 2 . Thus complex number multiplication is not closed on this circle.

The preceding paragraphs indicate that a little geometry can sometimes be of help in abstract algebra. We can use geometry to convince ourselves that $\mathbb{R}_{2 \pi}$ and $\mathbb{R}_{4 \pi}$ are isomorphic. Simply stretch out the interval $\mathbb{R}_{2 \pi}$ uniformly to cover the interval $\mathbb{R}_{4 \pi}$, or, if you prefer, use a magnifier of power 2 . Thus we set up the one-to-one correspondence $a \leftrightarrow 2 a$ between $a \in \mathbb{R}_{2 \pi}$ and $2 a \in \mathbb{R}_{4 \pi}$. The relation (8) for isomorphism becomes

$$
\text { if } a \leftrightarrow 2 a \text { and } b \leftrightarrow 2 b \text { then }(a+2 \pi b) \leftrightarrow(2 a+4 \pi 2 b) \text {. }
$$

This is obvious if $a+b \leq 2 \pi$. If $a+b=2 \pi+c$, then $2 a+2 b=4 \pi+2 c$, and the final pairing in the displayed relation becomes $c \leftrightarrow 2 c$, which is true.

1.13 Example $\quad x+{ }_{4 \pi} x+{ }_{4 \pi} x+{ }_{4 \pi} x=0$ in $\mathbb{R}_{4 \pi}$ has exactly four solutions, namely, $0, \pi, 2 \pi$, and $3 \pi$, which are two times the solutions found for the analogous equation in $\mathbb{R}_{2 \pi}$ in Example 1.12 .

There is nothing special about the numbers $2 \pi$ and $4 \pi$ in the previous argument. Surely, $\mathbb{R}_{c}$ with $+_{c}$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{R}_{d}$ with $+_{d}$ for all $c, d \in \mathbb{R}^{+}$. We need only pair $x \in \mathbb{R}_{c}$ with $(d / c) x \in \mathbb{R}_{d}$.

## Roots of Unity

The elements of the set $U_{n}=\left\{z \in \mathbb{C} \mid z^{n}=1\right\}$ are called the $\boldsymbol{n}^{\text {th }}$ roots of unity. Using the technique of Examples 1.6 and 1.7, we see that the elements of this set are the numbers

$$
\cos \left(m \frac{2 \pi}{n}\right)+i \sin \left(m \frac{2 \pi}{n}\right) \quad \text { for } \quad m=0,1,2, \cdots, n-1
$$

They all have absolute value 1 , so $U_{n} \subset U$. If we let $\zeta=\cos \frac{2 \pi}{n}+i \sin \frac{2 \pi}{n}$, then these $n^{\text {th }}$ roots of unity can be written as

$$
1=\zeta^{0}, \zeta^{1}, \zeta^{2}, \zeta^{3}, \cdots, \zeta^{n-1}
$$

Because $\zeta^{n}=1$, these $n$ powers of $\zeta$ are closed under multiplication. For example, with $n=10$, we have

$$
\zeta^{6} \zeta^{8}=\zeta^{14}=\zeta^{10} \zeta^{4}=1 \cdot \zeta^{4}=\zeta^{4}
$$

Thus we see that we can compute $\zeta^{i} \zeta^{j}$ by computing $i+{ }_{n} j$, viewing $i$ and $j$ as elements of $\mathbb{R}_{n}$.

Let $\mathbb{Z}_{n}=\{0,1,2,3, \cdots, n-1\}$. We see that $\mathbb{Z}_{n} \subset \mathbb{R}_{n}$ and clearly addition modulo $n$ is closed on $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$.

1.14 Example The solution of the equation $x+5=3$ in $\mathbb{Z}_{8}$ is $x=6$, because $5+{ }_{8} 6=11-8=3$.

If we rename each of the $n^{\text {th }}$ roots of unity in (10) by its exponent, we use for names all the elements of $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$. This gives a one-to-one correspondence between $U_{n}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$. Clearly,

$$
\begin{gathered}
\text { if } \quad \zeta^{i} \leftrightarrow i \text { and } \zeta^{j} \leftrightarrow j, \text { then }\left(\zeta^{i} \cdot \zeta^{j}\right) \leftrightarrow\left(i+_{n} j\right) \text {. } \\
\text { isomorphism }
\end{gathered}
$$

Thus $U_{n}$ with complex number multiplication and $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ with addition $+_{n}$ have the same algebraic properties.

1.15 Example It can be shown that there is an isomorphism of $U_{8}$ with $\mathbb{Z}_{8}$ in which $\zeta=e^{i 2 \pi / 8} \leftrightarrow 5$. Under this isomorphism, we must then have $\zeta^{2}=\zeta \cdot \zeta \leftrightarrow 5+{ }_{8} 5=2$.

Exercise 35 asks you to continue the computation in Example 1.15, finding the elements of $\mathbb{Z}_{8}$ to which each of the remaining six elements of $U_{8}$ correspond.

from calculus. Derive Euler's formula $e^{i \theta}=\cos \theta+i \sin \theta$ formally from these three series expansions.

## SECTION 2 Binary Operations

Suppose that we are visitors to a strange civilization in a strange world and are observing one of the creatures of this world drilling a class of fellow creatures in addition of numbers. Suppose also that we have not been told that the class is learning to add, but were just placed as observers in the room where this was going on. We are asked to give a report on exactly what happens. The teacher makes noises that sound to us approximately like gloop, poyt. The class responds with bimt. The teacher then gives ompt, gaft, and the class responds with poyt. What are they doing? We cannot report that they are adding numbers, for we do not even know that the sounds are representing numbers. Of course, we do realize that there is communication going on. All we can say with any certainty is that these creatures know some rule, so that when certain pairs of things are designated in their language, one after another, like gloop, poyt, they are able to agree on a response, bimt. This same procedure goes on in addition drill in our first grade classes where a teacher may say four, seven, and the class responds with eleven.

In our attempt to analyze addition and multiplication of numbers, we are thus led to the idea that addition is basically just a rule that people learn, enabling them to associate, with two numbers in a given order, some number as the answer. Multiplication is also such a rule, but a different rule. Note finally that in playing this game with students, teachers have to be a little careful of what two things they give to the class. If a first grade teacher suddenly inserts ten, sky, the class will be very confused. The rule is only defined for pairs of things from some specified set.

## Definitions and Examples

As mathematicians, let us attempt to collect the core of these basic ideas in a useful definition, generalizing the notions of addition and multiplication of numbers. As we remarked in Section 0, we do not attempt to define a set. However, we can attempt to be somewhat mathematically precise, and we describe our generalizations as functions (see Definition 0.10 and Example 0.11) rather than as rules. Recall from Definition 0.4 that for any set $S$, the set $S \times S$ consists of all ordered pairs $(a, b)$ for elements $a$ and $b$ of $S$.

2.1 Definition A binary operation $*$ on a set $S$ is a function mapping $S \times S$ into $S$. For each $(a, b) \in$ $S \times S$, we will denote the element $*((a, b))$ of $S$ by $a * b$.

Intuitively, we may regard a binary operation $*$ on $S$ as assigning, to each ordered pair $(a, b)$ of elements of $S$, an element $a * b$ of $S$. We proceed with examples.

2.2 Example Our usual addition + is a binary operation on the set $\mathbb{R}$. Our usual multiplication $\cdot$ is a different binary operation on $\mathbb{R}$. In this example, we could replace $\mathbb{R}$ by any of the sets $\mathbb{C}, \mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{R}^{+}$, or $\mathbb{Z}^{+}$.

Note that we require a binary operation on a set $S$ to be defined for every ordered pair $(a, b)$ of elements from $S$.

2.3 Example Let $M(\mathbb{R})$ be the set of all matrices ${ }^{\dagger}$ with real entries. The usual matrix addition + is not a binary operation on this set since $A+B$ is not defined for an ordered pair $(A, B)$ of matrices having different numbers of rows or of columns.

Sometimes a binary operation on $S$ provides a binary operation on a subset $H$ of $S$ also. We make a formal definition.

2.4 Definition Let $*$ be a binary operation on $S$ and let $H$ be a subset of $S$. The subset $H$ is closed under $*$ if for all $a, b \in H$ we also have $a * b \in H$. In this case, the binary operation on $H$ given by restricting $*$ to $H$ is the induced operation of $*$ on $H$.

By our very definition of a binary operation $*$ on $S$, the set $S$ is closed under $*$, but a subset may not be, as the following example shows.

2.5 Example Our usual addition + on the set $\mathbb{R}$ of real numbers does not induce a binary operation on the set $\mathbb{R}^{*}$ of nonzero real numbers because $2 \in \mathbb{R}^{*}$ and $-2 \in \mathbb{R}^{*}$, but $2+(-2)=0$ and $0 \notin \mathbb{R}^{*}$. Thus $\mathbb{R}^{*}$ is not closed under $*$.

In our text, we will often have occasion to decide whether a subset $H$ of $S$ is closed under a binary operation $*$ on $S$. To arrive at a correct conclusion, we have to know what it means for an element to be in $H$, and to use this fact. Students have trouble here. Be sure you understand the next example.

2.6 Example Let + and $\cdot$ be the usual binary operations of addition and multiplication on the set $\mathbb{Z}$, and let $H=\left\{n^{2} \mid n \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}\right\}$. Determine whether $H$ is closed under (a) addition and (b) multiplication.

For part (a), we need only observe that $1^{2}=1$ and $2^{2}=4$ are in $H$, but that $1+4=5$ and $5 \notin H$. Thus $H$ is not closed under addition.

For part (b), suppose that $r \in H$ and $s \in H$. Using what it means for $r$ and $s$ to be in $H$, we see that there must be integers $n$ and $m$ in $\mathbb{Z}^{+}$such that $r=n^{2}$ and $s=m^{2}$. Consequently, $r s=n^{2} m^{2}=(n m)^{2}$. By the characterization of elements in $H$ and the fact that $n m \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}$, this means that $r s \in H$, so $H$ is closed under multiplication.[^1]

2.7 Example Let $F$ be the set of all real-valued functions $f$ having as domain the set $\mathbb{R}$ of real numbers. We are familiar from calculus with the binary operations,,$+- \cdot$, and $\circ$ on $F$. Namely, for each ordered pair $(f, g)$ of functions in $F$, we define for each $x \in \mathbb{R}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
f+g \text { by }(f+g)(x) & =f(x)+g(x) & & \text { addition, } \\
f-g \text { by }(f-g)(x) & =f(x)-g(x) & & \text { subtraction, } \\
f \cdot g \text { by }(f \cdot g)(x) & =f(x) g(x) & & \text { multiplication, }
\end{aligned}
$$

and

$$
f \circ g \text { by }(f \circ g)(x)=f(g(x)) \quad \text { composition. }
$$

All four of these functions are again real valued with domain $\mathbb{R}$, so $F$ is closed under all four operations,,$+- \cdot$, and $\circ$.

The binary operations described in the examples above are very familiar to you. In this text, we want to abstract basic structural concepts from our familiar algebra. To emphasize this concept of abstraction from the familiar, we should illustrate these structural concepts with unfamiliar examples. We presented the binary operations of complex number multiplication on $U$ and $U_{n}$, addition $+_{n}$ on $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$, and addition $+{ }_{c}$ on $\mathbb{R}_{c}$ in Section 1.

The most important method of describing a particular binary operation $*$ on a given set is to characterize the element $a * b$ assigned to each pair $(a, b)$ by some property defined in terms of $a$ and $b$.

2.8 Example On $\mathbb{Z}^{+}$, we define a binary operation $*$ by $a * b$ equals the smaller of $a$ and $b$, or the common value if $a=b$. Thus $2 * 11=2 ; 15 * 10=10$; and $3 * 3=3$.

2.9 Example On $\mathbb{Z}^{+}$, we define a binary operation $*^{\prime}$ by $a *^{\prime} b=a$. Thus $2 *^{\prime} 3=2,25 *^{\prime} 10=25$, and $5 *^{\prime} 5=5$.

2.10 Example On $\mathbb{Z}^{+}$, we define a binary operation $*^{\prime \prime}$ by $a * \prime=(a * b)+2$, where $*$ is defined in Example 2.8. Thus $4 *^{\prime \prime} 7=6 ; 25 *^{\prime \prime} 9=11$; and $6 *^{\prime \prime} 6=8$.

It may seem that these examples are of no importance, but consider for a moment. Suppose we go into a store to buy a large, delicious chocolate bar. Suppose we see two identical bars side by side, the wrapper of one stamped $\$ 1.67$ and the wrapper of the other stamped $\$ 1.79$. Of course we pick up the one stamped $\$ 1.67$. Our knowledge of which one we want depends on the fact that at some time we learned the binary operation * of Example 2.8. It is a very important operation. Likewise, the binary operation $*^{\prime}$ of Example 2.9 is defined using our ability to distinguish order. Think what a problem we would have if we tried to put on our shoes first, and then our socks! Thus we should not be hasty about dismissing some binary operation as being of little significance. Of course, our usual operations of addition and multiplication of numbers have a practical importance well known to us.

Examples 2.8 and 2.9 were chosen to demonstrate that a binary operation may or may not depend on the order of the given pair. Thus in Example 2.8, $a * b=b * a$ for all $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}^{+^{\prime}}$, and in Example 2.9 this is not the case, for $5 *^{\prime} 7=5$ but $7 *^{\prime} 5=7$.

2.11 Definition A binary operation $*$ on a set $S$ is commutative if (and only if) $a * b=b * a$ for all $a, b \in S$.

As was pointed out in Section 0, it is customary in mathematics to omit the words and only if from a definition. Definitions are always understood to be if and only if statements. Theorems are not always if and only if statements, and no such convention is ever used for theorems.

Now suppose we wish to consider an expression of the form $a * b * c$. A binary operation $*$ enables us to combine only two elements, and here we have three. The obvious attempts to combine the three elements are to form either $(a * b) * c$ or $a *(b * c)$. With $*$ defined as in Example 2.8, $(2 * 5) * 9$ is computed by $2 * 5=2$ and then $2 * 9=2$. Likewise, $2 *(5 * 9)$ is computed by $5 * 9=5$ and then $2 * 5=2$. Hence $(2 * 5) * 9=$ $2 *(5 * 9)$, and it is not hard to see that for this $*$,

$$
(a * b) * c=a *(b * c),
$$

so there is no ambiguity in writing $a * b * c$. But for $*^{\prime \prime}$ of Example 2.10,

$$
\left(2 *^{\prime \prime} 5\right) *^{\prime \prime} 9=4 *^{\prime \prime} 9=6,
$$

while

$$
2 *^{\prime \prime}\left(5 *^{\prime \prime} 9\right)=2 *^{\prime \prime} 7=4 .
$$

Thus $\left(a *^{\prime \prime} b\right) *^{\prime \prime} c$ need not equal $a *^{\prime \prime}\left(b *^{\prime \prime} c\right)$, and an expression $a *^{\prime \prime} b *^{\prime \prime} c$ may be ambiguous.

2.12 Definition A binary operation on a set $S$ is associative if $(a * b) * c=a *(b * c)$ for all $a, b, c \in S$.

It can be shown that if $*$ is associative, then longer expressions such as $a * b *$ $c * d$ are not ambiguous. Parentheses may be inserted in any fashion for purposes of computation; the final results of two such computations will be the same.

Composition of functions mapping $\mathbb{R}$ into $\mathbb{R}$ was reviewed in Example 2.7. For any set $S$ and any functions $f$ and $g$ mapping $S$ into $S$, we similarly define the composition $f \circ g$ of $g$ followed by $f$ as the function mapping $S$ into $S$ such that $(f \circ g)(x)=f(g(x))$ for all $x \in S$. Some of the most important binary operations we consider are defined using composition of functions. It is important to know that this composition is always associative whenever it is defined.

2.13 Theorem (Associativity of Composition) Let $S$ be a set and let $f, g$, and $h$ be functions mapping $S$ into $S$. Then $f \circ(g \circ h)=(f \circ g) \circ h$.

Proof To show these two functions are equal, we must show that they give the same assignment to each $x \in S$. Computing we find that

$$
(f \circ(g \circ h))(x)=f((g \circ h)(x))=f(g(h(x)))
$$

and

$$
((f \circ g) \circ h)(x)=(f \circ g)(h(x))=f(g(h(x))),
$$

so the same element $f(g(h(x)))$ of $S$ is indeed obtained.

As an example of using Theorem 2.13 to save work, recall that it is a fairly painful exercise in summation notation to show that multiplication of $n \times n$ matrices is an associative binary operation. If, in a linear algebra course, we first show that there is a one-to-one correspondence between matrices and linear transformations and that multiplication of matrices corresponds to the composition of the linear transformations (functions), we obtain this associativity at once from Theorem 2.13.

## Tables

For a finite set, a binary operation on the set can be defined by means of a table in which the elements of the set are listed across the top as heads of columns and at the left side as heads of rows. We always require that the elements of the set be listed as heads across the top in the same order as heads down the left side. The next example illustrates the use of a table to define a binary operation.

2.14 Example

### 2.15 Table

| $*$ | $a$ | $b$ | $c$ |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| $a$ | $b$ | $c$ | $b$ |
| $b$ | $a$ | $c$ | $b$ |
| $c$ | $c$ | $b$ | $a$ |

2.16 Example Solution

2.17 Table

2.18 Table

|  | $a$ | $b$ | $c$ | $d$ |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| $a$ | $b$ | $d$ | $a$ | $a$ |
| $b$ | $d$ | $d$ | $c$ | $b$ |
| $c$ | $a$ | $c$ | $\searrow$ | $b$ |
| $d$ | $a$ | $b$ | $b$ | $\searrow$ |

Table 2.15 defines the binary operation $*$ on $S=\{a, b, c\}$ by the following rule:

( $i$ th entry on the left) $*(j$ th entry on the top)

$=($ entry in the $i$ th row and $j$ th column of the table body $)$.

Thus $a * b=c$ and $b * a=a$, so $*$ is not commutative.

We can easily see that a binary operation defined by a table is commutative if and only if the entries in the table are symmetric with respect to the diagonal that starts at the upper left corner of the table and terminates at the lower right corner.

Complete Table 2.17 so that $*$ is a commutative binary operation on the set $S=$ $\{a, b, c, d\}$.

From Table 2.17, we see that $b * a=d$. For $*$ to be commutative, we must have $a * b=$ $d$ also. Thus we place $d$ in the appropriate square defining $a * b$, which is located symmetrically across the diagonal in Table 2.18 from the square defining $b * a$. We obtain the rest of Table 2.18 in this fashion to give our solution.

## Some Words of Warning

Classroom experience shows the chaos that may result if a student is given a set and asked to define some binary operation on it. Remember that in an attempt to define a binary operation $*$ on a set $\mathrm{S}$ we must be sure that

1. exactly one element is assigned to each possible ordered pair of elements of $S$,
2. for each ordered pair of elements of $S$, the element assigned to it is again in $S$.

Regarding Condition 1, a student will often make an attempt that assigns an element of $S$ to "most" ordered pairs, but for a few pairs, determines no element. In this event, * is not everywhere defined on $S$. It may also happen that for some pairs, the attempt could assign any of several elements of $S$, that is, there is ambiguity. In any case
of ambiguity, $*$ is not well defined. If Condition 2 is violated, then $S$ is not closed under $*$.

Following are several illustrations of attempts to define binary operations on sets. Some of them are worthless. The symbol $*$ is used for the attempted operation in all these examples.

2.19 Example $\quad$ On $\mathbb{Q}$, let $a * b=a / b$. Here $*$ is not everywhere defined on $\mathbb{Q}$, for no rational number is assigned by this rule to the pair $(2,0)$.

2.20 Example On $\mathbb{Q}^{+}$, let $a * b=a / b$. Here both Conditions 1 and 2 are satisfied, and $*$ is a binary operation on $\mathbb{Q}^{+}$.

2.21 Example On $\mathbb{Z}^{+}$, let $a * b=a / b$. Here Condition 2 fails, for $1 * 3$ is not in $\mathbb{Z}^{+}$. Thus $*$ is not a binary operation on $\mathbb{Z}^{+}$, since $\mathbb{Z}^{+}$is not closed under $*$.

2.22 Example Let $F$ be the set of all real-valued functions with domain $\mathbb{R}$ as in Example 2.7. Suppose we "define" * to give the usual quotient of $f$ by $g$, that is, $f * g=h$, where $h(x)=$ $f(x) / g(x)$. Here Condition 2 is violated, for the functions in $F$ were to be defined for all real numbers, and for some $g \in F, g(x)$ will be zero for some values of $x$ in $\mathbb{R}$ and $h(x)$ would not be defined at those numbers in $\mathbb{R}$. For example, if $f(x)=\cos x$ and $g(x)=x^{2}$, then $h(0)$ is undefined, so $h \notin F$.

2.23 Example Let $F$ be as in Example 2.22 and let $f * g=h$, where $h$ is the function greater than both $f$ and $g$. This "definition" is completely worthless. In the first place, we have not defined what it means for one function to be greater than another. Even if we had, any sensible definition would result in there being many functions greater than both $f$ and $g$, and $*$ would still be not well defined.

2.24 Example Let $S$ be a set consisting of 20 people, no two of whom are of the same height. Define $*$ by $a * b=c$, where $c$ is the tallest person among the 20 in $S$. This is a perfectly good binary operation on the set, although not a particularly interesting one.

2.25 Example Let $S$ be as in Example 2.24 and let $a * b=c$, where $c$ is the shortest person in $S$ who is taller than both $a$ and $b$. This $*$ is not everywhere defined, since if either $a$ or $b$ is the tallest person in the set, $a * b$ is not determined.

14. A binary operation $*$ is commutative if and only if $a * b=b * a$.

## Theory

26. Prove that if $*$ is an associative and commutative binary operation on a set $S$, then

$$
(a * b) *(c * d)=[(d * c) * a] * b
$$

for all $a, b, c, d \in S$. Assume the associative law only for triples as in the definition, that is, assume only

$$
(x * y) * z=x *(y * z)
$$

for all $x, y, z \in S$.

In Exercises 27 and 28, either prove the statement or give a counterexample.

27. Every binary operation on a set consisting of a single element is both commutative and associative.
28. Every commutative binary operation on a set having just two elements is associative.

Let $F$ be the set of all real-valued functions having as domain the set $\mathbb{R}$ of all real numbers. Example 2.7 defined the binary operations,,$+- \cdot$, and $\circ$ on $F$. In Exercises 29 through 35, either prove the given statement or give a counterexample.

29. Function addition + on $F$ is associative.
30. Function subtraction - on $F$ is commutative
31. Function subtraction - on $F$ is associative.
32. Function multiplication $\cdot$ on $F$ is commutative.
33. Function multiplication $\cdot$ on $F$ is associative.
34. Function composition $\circ$ on $F$ is commutative.
35. If $*$ and $*^{\prime}$ are any two binary operations on a set $S$, then

$$
a *\left(b *^{\prime} c\right)=(a * b) *^{\prime}(a * c) \quad \text { for all } \quad a, b, c \in S
$$

36. Suppose that $*$ is an associative binary operation on a set $S$. Let $H=\{a \in S \mid a * x=x * a$ for all $x \in S\}$. Show that $H$ is closed under $*$. (We think of $H$ as consisting of all elements of $S$ that commute with every element in $S$.)
37. Suppose that $*$ is an associative and commutative binary operation on a set $S$. Show that $H=\{a \in S \mid a * a=a\}$ is closed under $*$. (The elements of $H$ are idempotents of the binary operation $*$.)

## SECTION 3 ISOMORPhic Binary Structures

Compare Table 3.1 for the binary operation $*$ on the set $S=\{a, b, c\}$ with Table 3.2 for the binary operation $*^{\prime}$ on the set $T=\{\#, \$, \&\}$.

Notice that if, in Table 3.1, we replace all occurrences of $a$ by \#, every $b$ by $\$$, and every $c$ by $\&$ using the one-to-one correspondence

$$
a \leftrightarrow \# \quad b \leftrightarrow \$ \quad c \leftrightarrow \&
$$

we obtain precisely Table 3.2. The two tables differ only in the symbols (or names) denoting the elements and the symbols $*$ and $*^{\prime}$ for the operations. If we rewrite Table 3.3 with elements in the order $y, x, z$, we obtain Table 3.4. (Here we did not set up any oneone-correpondence; we just listed the same elements in different order outside the heavy bars of the table.) Replacing, in Table 3.1, all occurrences of $a$ by $y$, every $b$ by $x$, and every $c$ by $z$ using the one-to-one correspondence

$$
a \leftrightarrow y \quad b \leftrightarrow x \quad c \leftrightarrow z
$$

we obtain Table 3.4. We think of Tables 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 as being structurally alike. These four tables differ only in the names (or symbols) for their elements and in the order that those elements are listed as heads in the tables. However, Table 3.5 for binary operation $\bar{*}$ and Table 3.6 for binary operation $\hat{*}$ on the set $S=\{a, b, c\}$ are structurally different from each other and from Table 3.1. In Table 3.1, each element appears three times in the body of the table, while the body of Table 3.5 contains the single element $b$. In Table 3.6, for all $s \in S$ we get the same value $c$ for $s \hat{*} s$ along the upper-left to lowerright diagonal, while we get three different values in Table 3.1. Thus Tables 3.1 through 3.6 give just three structurally different binary operations on a set of three elements, provided we disregard the names of the elements and the order in which they appear as heads in the tables.

The situation we have just discussed is somewhat akin to children in France and in Germany learning the operation of addition on the set $\mathbb{Z}^{+}$. The children have different

names (un, deux, trois, $\cdots$ versus eins, zwei, drei $\cdots$ ) for the numbers, but they are learning the same binary structure. (In this case, they are also using the same symbols for the numbers, so their addition tables would appear the same if they list the numbers in the same order.)

We are interested in studying the different types of structures that binary operations can provide on sets having the same number of elements, as typified by Tables 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6. Let us consider a binary algebraic structure ${ }^{\dagger}\langle S, *\rangle$ to be a set $S$ together with a binary operation $*$ on $S$. In order for two such binary structures $\langle S, *\rangle$ and $\left\langle S^{\prime}, *^{\prime}\right\rangle$ to be structurally alike in the sense we have described, we would have to have a one-to-one correspondence between the elements $x$ of $S$ and the elements $x^{\prime}$ of $S^{\prime}$ such that

$$
\text { if } \quad x \leftrightarrow x^{\prime} \quad \text { and } \quad y \leftrightarrow y^{\prime}, \quad \text { then } \quad x * y \leftrightarrow x^{\prime} *^{\prime} y^{\prime} .
$$

A one-to-one correspondence exists if the sets $S$ and $S^{\prime}$ have the same number of elements. It is customary to describe a one-to-one correspondence by giving a oneto-one function $\phi$ mapping $S$ onto $S^{\prime}$ (see Definition 0.12). For such a function $\phi$, we regard the equation $\phi(x)=x^{\prime}$ as reading the one-to-one pairing $x \leftrightarrow x^{\prime}$ in left-to-right order. In terms of $\phi$, the final $\leftrightarrow$ correspondence in (1), which asserts the algebraic structure in $S^{\prime}$ is the same as in $S$, can be expressed as

$$
\phi(x * y)=\phi(x) *^{\prime} \phi(y) .
$$

Such a function showing that two algebraic systems are structurally alike is known as an isomorphism. We give a formal definition.

3.7 Definition Let $\langle S, *\rangle$ and $\left\langle S^{\prime}, *^{\prime}\right\rangle$ be binary algebraic structures. An isomorphism of $S$ with $S^{\prime}$ is a one-to-one function $\phi$ mapping $S$ onto $S^{\prime}$ such that

$$
\phi(x * y)=\phi(x) *^{\prime} \phi(y) \text { for all } x, y \in S .
$$

homomorphism property[^2]

If such a map $\phi$ exists, then $S$ and $S^{\prime}$ are isomorphic binary structures, which we denote by $S \simeq S^{\prime}$, omitting the $*$ and $*^{\prime}$ from the notation.

You may wonder why we labeled the displayed condition in Definition 3.7 the homomorphism property rather than the isomorphism property. The notion of isomorphism includes the idea of one-to-one correspondence, which appeared in the definition via the words one-to-one and onto before the display. In Chapter 13, we will discuss the relation between $S$ and $S^{\prime}$ when $\phi: S \rightarrow S^{\prime}$ satisfies the displayed homomorphism property, but $\phi$ is not necessarily one to one; $\phi$ is then called a homomorphism rather than an isomorphism.

It is apparent that in Section 1, we showed that the binary structures $\langle U, \cdot\rangle$ and $\left\langle\mathbb{R}_{c},+_{c}\right\rangle$ are isomorphic for all $c \in \mathbb{R}^{+}$. Also, $\left\langle U_{n}, \cdot\right\rangle$ and $\left\langle\mathbb{Z}_{n},+_{n}\right\rangle$ are isomorphic for each $n \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}$.

Exercise 28 asks us to show that for a collection of binary algebraic structures, the relation $\simeq$ in Definition 3.7 is an equivalence relation on the collection. Our discussion leading to the preceding definition shows that the binary structures defined by Tables 3.1 through 3.4 are in the same equivalence class, while those given by Tables 3.5 and 3.6 are in different equivalence classes. We proceed to discuss how to try to determine whether binary structures are isomorphic.

## How to Show That Binary Structures Are Isomorphic

We now give an outline showing how to proceed from Definition 3.7 to show that two binary structures $\langle S, *\rangle$ and $\left\langle S^{\prime}, *^{\prime}\right\rangle$ are isomorphic.

Step 1 Define the function $\phi$ that gives the isomorphism of $S$ with $S^{\prime}$. Now this means that we have to describe, in some fashion, what $\phi(s)$ is to be for every $s \in S$.

Step 2 Show that $\phi$ is a one-to-one function. That is, suppose that $\phi(x)=\phi(y)$ in $S^{\prime}$ and deduce from this that $x=y$ in $S$.

Step 3 Show that $\phi$ is onto $S^{\prime}$. That is, suppose that $s^{\prime} \in S^{\prime}$ is given and show that there does exist $s \in S$ such that $\phi(s)=s^{\prime}$.

Step 4 Show that $\phi(x * y)=\phi(x) *^{\prime} \phi(y)$ for all $x, y \in S$. This is just a question of computation. Compute both sides of the equation and see whether they are the same.

3.8 Example Let us show that the binary structure $\langle\mathbb{R},+\rangle$ with operation the usual addition is isomorphic to the structure $\left\langle\mathbb{R}^{+}, \cdot\right\rangle$ where $\cdot$ is the usual multiplication.

Step 1 We have to somehow convert an operation of addition to multiplication. Recall from $a^{b+c}=\left(a^{b}\right)\left(a^{c}\right)$ that addition of exponents corresponds to multiplication of two quantities. Thus we try defining $\phi: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{+}$by $\phi(x)=e^{x}$ for $x \in \mathbb{R}$. Note that $e^{x}>0$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$, so indeed, $\phi(x) \in \mathbb{R}^{+}$.

Step 2 If $\phi(x)=\phi(y)$, then $e^{x}=e^{y}$. Taking the natural logarithm, we see that $x=y$, so $\phi$ is indeed one to one.

Step 3 If $r \in \mathbb{R}^{+}$, then $\ln (r) \in \mathbb{R}$ and $\phi(\ln r)=e^{\ln r}=r$. Thus $\phi$ is onto $\mathbb{R}^{+}$.

Step 4 For $x, y \in \mathbb{R}$, we have $\phi(x+y)=e^{x+y}=e^{x} \cdot e^{y}=\phi(x) \cdot \phi(y)$. Thus we see that $\phi$ is indeed an isomorphism.

3.9 Example $\quad$ Let $2 \mathbb{Z}=\{2 n \mid n \in \mathbb{Z}\}$, so that $2 \mathbb{Z}$ is the set of all even integers, positive, negative, and zero. We claim that $\langle\mathbb{Z},+\rangle$ is isomorphic to $\langle 2 \mathbb{Z},+\rangle$, where + is the usual addition. This will give an example of a binary structure $\langle\mathbb{Z},+\rangle$ that is actually isomorphic to a structure consisting of a proper subset under the induced operation, in contrast to Example 3.8, where the operations were totally different.

Step 1 The obvious function $\phi: \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow 2 \mathbb{Z}$ to try is given by $\phi(n)=2 n$ for $n \in \mathbb{Z}$.

Step 2 If $\phi(m)=\phi(n)$, then $2 m=2 n$ so $m=n$. Thus $\phi$ is one to one.

Step 3 If $n \in 2 \mathbb{Z}$, then $n$ is even so $n=2 m$ for $m=n / 2 \in \mathbb{Z}$. Hence $\phi(m)=2(n / 2)=n$ so $\phi$ is onto $2 \mathbb{Z}$.

Step 4 Let $m, n \in \mathbb{Z}$. The equation

$$
\phi(m+n)=2(m+n)=2 m+2 n=\phi(m)+\phi(n)
$$

then shows that $\phi$ is an isomorphism.

## How to Show That Binary Structures Are Not Isomorphic

We now turn to the reverse question, namely:

How do we demonstrate that two binary structures $\langle S, *\rangle$ and $\left\langle S^{\prime}, *^{\prime}\right\rangle$ are not isomorphic, if this is the case?

This would mean that there is no one-to-one function $\phi$ from $S$ onto $S^{\prime}$ with the property $\phi(x * y)=\phi(x) *^{\prime} \phi(y)$ for all $x, y \in S$. In general, it is clearly not feasible to try every possible one-to-one function mapping $S$ onto $S^{\prime}$ and test whether it has this property, except in the case where there are no such functions. This is the case precisely when $S$ and $S^{\prime}$ do not have the same cardinality. (See Definition 0.13.)

3.10 Example The binary structures $\langle\mathbb{Q},+\rangle$ and $\langle\mathbb{R},+\rangle$ are not isomorphic because $\mathbb{Q}$ has cardinality $\aleph_{0}$ while $|\mathbb{R}| \neq \aleph_{0}$. (See the discussion following Example 0.13.) Note that it is not enough to say that $\mathbb{Q}$ is a proper subset of $\mathbb{R}$. Example 3.9 shows that a proper subset with the induced operation can indeed be isomorphic to the entire binary structure.

A structural property of a binary structure is one that must be shared by any isomorphic structure. It is not concerned with names or some other nonstructural characteristics of the elements. For example, the binary structures defined by Tables 3.1 and 3.2 are isomorphic, although the elements are totally different. Also, a structural property is not concerned with what we consider to be the "name" of the binary operation. Example 3.8 showed that a binary structure whose operation is our usual addition can be isomorphic to one whose operation is our usual multiplication. The number of elements in the set $S$ is a structural property of $\langle\mathrm{S}, *\rangle$.

We are interested in studying the different types of structures that binary operations can provide on sets having the same number of elements, as typified by Tables 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6. Let us consider a binary algebraic structure ${ }^{\dagger}\langle S, *\rangle$ to be a set $S$ together with a binary operation $*$ on $S$. In order for two such binary structures $\langle S, *\rangle$ and $\left\langle S^{\prime}, *^{\prime}\right\rangle$ to be structurally alike in the sense we have described, we would have to have a one-to-one correspondence between the elements $x$ of $S$ and the elements $x^{\prime}$ of $S^{\prime}$ such that

$$
\text { if } \quad x \leftrightarrow x^{\prime} \quad \text { and } \quad y \leftrightarrow y^{\prime}, \quad \text { then } \quad x * y \leftrightarrow x^{\prime} *^{\prime} y^{\prime} .
$$

A one-to-one correspondence exists if the sets $S$ and $S^{\prime}$ have the same number of elements. It is customary to describe a one-to-one correspondence by giving a oneto-one function $\phi$ mapping $S$ onto $S^{\prime}$ (see Definition 0.12). For such a function $\phi$, we regard the equation $\phi(x)=x^{\prime}$ as reading the one-to-one pairing $x \leftrightarrow x$ in left-to-right order. In terms of $\phi$, the final $\leftrightarrow$ correspondence in (1), which asserts the algebraic structure in $S^{\prime}$ is the same as in $S$, can be expressed as

$$
\phi(x * y)=\phi(x) *^{\prime} \phi(y) .
$$

Such, a function showing that two algebraic systems are structurally alike is known as an isomorphism. We give a formal definition.

3.7 Definition Let $\langle S, *\rangle$ and $\left\langle S^{\prime}, *^{\prime}\right\rangle$ be binary algebraic structures. An isomorphism of $S$ with $S^{\prime}$ is a one-to-one function $\phi$ mapping $S$ onto $S^{\prime}$ such that

$$
\phi(x * y)=\phi(x) *^{\prime} \phi(y) \text { for all } x, y \in S
$$

homomorphism property[^3]

If you now have a good grasp of the notion of isomorphic binary structures, it should be evident that having an identity element for $*$ is indeed a structural property of a structure $\langle S, *\rangle$. However, we know from experience that many readers will be unable to see the forest because of all the trees that have appeared. For them, we now supply a careful proof, skipping along to touch those trees that are involved.

3.14 Theorem Suppose $\langle S, *\rangle$ has an identity element $e$ for $*$. If $\phi: S \rightarrow S^{\prime}$ is an isomorphism of $\langle S, *\rangle$ with $\left\langle S^{\prime}, *^{\prime}\right\rangle$, then $\phi(e)$ is an identity element for the binary operation $*^{\prime}$ on $S^{\prime}$.

Proof Let $s^{\prime} \in S^{\prime}$. We must show that $\phi(e) *^{\prime} s^{\prime}=s^{\prime} *^{\prime} \phi(e)=s^{\prime}$. Because $\phi$ is an isomorphism, it is a one-to-one map of $S$ onto $S^{\prime}$. In particular, there exists $s \in S$ such that $\phi(s)=s^{\prime}$. Now $e$ is an identity element for $*$ so that we know that $e * s=s * e=s$. Because $\phi$ is a function, we then obtain

$$
\phi(e * s)=\phi(s * e)=\phi(s) .
$$

Using Definition 3.7 of an isomorphism, we can rewrite this as

$$
\phi(e) *^{\prime} \phi(s)=\phi(s) *^{\prime} \phi(e)=\phi(s) \text {. }
$$

Remembering that we chose $s \in S$ such that $\phi(s)=s^{\prime}$, we obtain the desired relation $\phi(e) *^{\prime} s^{\prime}=s^{\prime} *^{\prime} \phi(e)=s^{\prime}$.

We conclude with three more examples showing via structural properties that certain binary structures are not isomorphic. In the exercises we ask you to show, as in Theorem 3.14, that the properties we use to distinguish the structures in these examples are indeed structural. That is, they must be shared by any isomorphic structure.

3.15 Example We show that the binary structures $\langle\mathbb{Q},+\rangle$ and $\langle\mathbb{Z},+\rangle$ under the usual addition are not isomorphic. (Both $\mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathbb{Z}$ have cardinality $\aleph_{0}$, so there are lots of one-to-one functions mapping $\mathbb{Q}$ onto $\mathbb{Z}$.) The equation $x+x=c$ has a solution $x$ for all $c \in \mathbb{Q}$, but this is not the case in $\mathbb{Z}$. For example, the equation $x+x=3$ has no solution in $\mathbb{Z}$. We have exhibited a structural property that distinguishes these two structures.

3.16 Example The binary structures $\langle\mathbb{C}, \cdot\rangle$ and $\langle\mathbb{R}, \cdot\rangle$ under the usual multiplication are not isomorphic. (It can be shown that $\mathbb{C}$ and $\mathbb{R}$ have the same cardinality.) The equation $x \cdot x=c$ has a solution $x$ for all $c \in \mathbb{C}$, but $x \cdot x=-1$ has no solution in $\mathbb{R}$.

3.17 Example The binary structure $\left\langle M_{2}(\mathbb{R}), \cdot\right\rangle$ of $2 \times 2$ real matrices with the usual matrix multiplication is not isomorphic to $\langle\mathbb{R}, \cdot\rangle$ with the usual number multiplication. (It can be shown that both sets have cardinality $|\mathbb{R}|$.) Multiplication of numbers is commutative, but multiplication of matrices is not.

## Concepts

20. The displayed homomorphism condition for an isomorphism $\phi$ in Definition 3.7 is sometimes summarized by saying, " $\phi$ must commute with the binary operation(s)." Explain how that condition can be viewed in this manner.

In Exercises 21 and 22, correct the definition of the italicized term without reference to the text, if correction is needed, so that it is in a form acceptable for publication.

21. A function $\phi: S \rightarrow S^{\prime}$ is an isomorphism if and only if $\phi(a * b)=\phi(a) *^{\prime} \phi(b)$.
22. Let $*$ be a binary operation on a set $S$. An element $e$ of $S$ with the property $s * e=s=e * s$ is an identity element for $*$ for all $s \in S$.

## Proof Synopsis

A good test of your understanding of a proof is your ability to give a one or two sentence synopsis of it, explaining the idea of the proof without all the details and computations. Note that we said "sentence" and not "equation." From now on, some of our exercise sets may contain one or two problems asking for a synopsis of a proof in the text. It should rarely exceed three sentences. We should illustrate for you what we mean by a synopsis. Here is our one-sentence synopsis of Theorem 3.14. Read the statement of the theorem now, and then our synopsis.

Representing an element of $S^{\prime}$ as $\phi(s)$ for some $s \in S$, use the homomorphism property

of $\phi$ to carry the computation of $\phi(e) *^{\prime} \phi(s)$ back to a computation in $S$.

That is the kind of explanation that one mathematician might give another if asked, "How does the proof go?" We did not make the computation or explain why we could represent an element of $S^{\prime}$ as $\phi(s)$. To supply every detail would result in a completely written proof. We just gave the guts of the argument in our synopsis.

23. Give a proof synopsis of Theorem 3.13.

## Theory

24. An identity element for a binary operation $*$ as described by Definition 3.12 is sometimes referred to as "a two-sided identity element." Using complete sentences, give analogous definitions for
a. a left identity element $e_{L}$ for $*$, and
b. a right identity element $e_{R}$ for $*$.

Theorem 3.13 shows that if a two-sided identity element for $*$ exists, it is unique. Is the same true for a one-sided identity element you just defined? If so, prove it. If not, give a counterexample $\langle S, *\rangle$ for a finite set $S$ and find the first place where the proof of Theorem 3.13 breaks down.

25. Continuing the ideas of Exercise 24 can a binary structure have a left identity element $e_{L}$ and a right identity element $e_{R}$ where $e_{L} \neq e_{R}$ ? If so, give an example, using an operation on a finite set $S$. If not, prove that it is impossible.
26. Recall that if $f: A \rightarrow B$ is a one-to-one function mapping $A$ onto $B$, then $f^{-1}(b)$ is the unique $a \in A$ such that $f(a)=b$. Prove that if $\phi: S \rightarrow S^{\prime}$ is an isomorphism of $\langle S, *\rangle$ with $\left\langle S^{\prime}, *^{\prime}\right\rangle$, then $\phi^{-1}$ is an isomorphism of $\left\langle S^{\prime}, *^{\prime}\right\rangle$ with $\langle S, *\rangle$.
27. Prove that if $\phi: S \rightarrow S^{\prime}$ is an isomorphism of $\langle S, *\rangle$ with $\left\langle S^{\prime}, *^{\prime}\right\rangle$ and $\psi: S^{\prime} \rightarrow S^{\prime \prime}$ is an isomorphism of $\left\langle S^{\prime}, *^{\prime}\right\rangle$ with $\left\langle S^{\prime \prime}, *^{\prime \prime}\right\rangle$, then the composite function $\psi \circ \phi$ is an isomorphism of $\langle S, *\rangle$ with $\left\langle S^{\prime \prime}, *^{\prime \prime}\right\rangle$.
28. Prove that the relation $\simeq$ of being isomorphic, described in Definition 3.7 , is an equivalence relation on any set of binary structures. You may simply quote the results you were asked to prove in the preceding two exercises at appropriate places in your proof.

In Exercises 29 through 32, give a careful proof for a skeptic that the indicated property of a binary structure $\langle S, *\rangle$ is indeed a structural property. (In Theorem 3.14, we did this for the property, "There is an identity element for *.")

29. The operation $*$ is commutative.
30. The operation $*$ is associative.
31. For each $c \in S$, the equation $x * x=c$ has a solution $x$ in $S$.
32. There exists an element $b$ in $S$ such that $b * b=b$.
33. Let $H$ be the subset of $M_{2}(\mathbb{R})$ consisting of all matrices of the form $\left[\begin{array}{ll}a & -b \\ b & a\end{array}\right]$ for $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$. Exercise 23 of Section 2 shows that $H$ is closed under both matrix addition and matrix multiplication.

a. Show that $\langle\mathbb{C},+\rangle$ is isomorphic to $\langle H,+\rangle$.

b. Show that $\langle\mathbb{C}, \cdot\rangle$ is isomorphic to $\langle H, \cdot\rangle$.

(We say that $H$ is a matrix representation of the complex numbers $\mathbb{C}$.)

34. There are 16 possible binary structures on the set $\{a, b\}$ of two elements. How many nonisomorphic (that is, structurally different) structures are there among these 16 ? Phrased more precisely in terms of the isomorphism equivalence relation $\simeq$ on this set of 16 structures, how many equivalence classes are there? Write down one structure from each equivalence class. [Hint: Interchanging $a$ and $b$ everywhere in a table and then rewriting the table with elements listed in the original order does not always yield a table different from the one we started with.]

## SECTION 4 Groups

Let us continue the analysis of our past experience with algebra. Once we had mastered the computational problems of addition and multiplication of numbers, we were ready to apply these binary operations to the solution of problems. Often problems lead to equations involving some unknown number $x$, which is to be determined. The simplest equations are the linear ones of the forms $a+x=b$ for the operation of addition, and $a x=b$ for multiplication. The additive linear equation always has a numerical solution, and so has the multiplicative one, provided $a \neq 0$. Indeed, the need for solutions of additive linear equations such as $5+x=2$ is a very good motivation for the negative numbers. Similarly, the need for rational numbers is shown by equations such as $2 x=3$.

It is desirable for us to be able to solve linear equations involving our binary operations. This is not possible for every binary operation, however. For example, the equation $a * x=a$ has no solution in $S=\{a, b, c\}$ for the operation $*$ of Example 2.14. Let us abstract from familiar algebra those properties of addition that enable us to solve the equation $5+x=2$ in $\mathbb{Z}$. We must not refer to subtraction, for we are concerned with the solution phrased in terms of a single binary operation, in this case addition. The steps in
the solution are as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
5+x & =2, & & \text { given, } \\
-5+(5+x) & =-5+2, & & \text { adding }-5, \\
(-5+5)+x & =-5+2, & & \text { associative law, } \\
0+x & =-5+2, & & \text { computing }-5+5, \\
x & =-5+2, & & \text { property of } 0, \\
x & =-3, & & \text { computing }-5+2 .
\end{aligned}
$$

Strictly speaking, we have not shown here that -3 is a solution, but rather that it is the only possibility for a solution. To show that -3 is a solution, one merely computes $5+(-3)$. A similar analysis could be made for the equation $2 x=3$ in the rational numbers with the operation of multiplication:

$$
\begin{aligned}
2 x & =3, & & \text { given, } \\
\frac{1}{2}(2 x) & =\frac{1}{2}(3), & & \text { multiplying by } \frac{1}{2}, \\
\left(\frac{1}{2} \cdot 2\right) x & =\frac{1}{2} 3, & & \text { associative law, } \\
1 \cdot x & =\frac{1}{2} 3, & & \text { computing } \frac{1}{2} 2, \\
x & =\frac{1}{2} 3, & & \text { property of } 1, \\
x & =\frac{3}{2}, & & \text { computing } \frac{1}{2} 3 .
\end{aligned}
$$

We can now see what properties a set $S$ and a binary operation $*$ on $S$ would have to have to permit imitation of this procedure for an equation $a * x=b$ for $a, b \in S$. Basic to the procedure is the existence of an element $e$ in $S$ with the property that $e * x=x$ for all $x \in S$. For our additive example, 0 played the role of $e$, and 1 played the role for our multiplicative example. Then we need an element $a^{\prime}$ in $S$ that has the property that $a^{\prime} * a=e$. For our additive example with $a=5,-5$ played the role of $a^{\prime}$, and $\frac{1}{2}$ played the role for our multiplicative example with $a=2$. Finally we need the associative law. The remainder is just computation. A similar analysis shows that in order to solve the equation $x * a=b$ (remember that $a * x$ need not equal $x * a$ ), we would like to have an element $e$ in $S$ such that $x * e=x$ for all $x \in S$ and an $a^{\prime}$ in $S$ such that $a * a^{\prime}=e$. With all of these properties of $*$ on $S$, we could be sure of being able to solve linear equations. Thus we need an associative binary structure $\langle S, *\rangle$ with an identity element $e$ such that for each $a \in S$, there exists $a^{\prime} \in S$ such that $a * a^{\prime}=a^{\prime} * a=e$. This is precisely the notion of a group, which we now define.

## Definition and Examples

Rather than describe a group using terms defined in Sections 2 and 3 as we did at the end of the preceding paragraph, we give a self-contained definition. This enables a person who picks up this text to discover what a group is without having to look up more terms.

4.1 Definition A group $\langle G, *\rangle$ is a set $G$, closed under a binary operation $*$, such that the following axioms are satisfied:

$\mathscr{G}_{1}:$ For all $a, b, c \in G$, we have

$$
(a * b) * c=a *(b * c) \text {. associativity of } *
$$

## Part I Groups and Subgroups

$\mathscr{T}_{2}$ : There is an element $e$ in $G$ such that for all $x \in G$,

$$
e * x=x * e=x . \quad \text { identity element } e \text { for } *
$$

$\mathscr{G}_{3}$ : Corresponding to each $a \in G$, there is an element $a^{\prime}$ in $G$ such that

$$
a * a^{\prime}=a^{\prime} * a=e . \quad \text { inverse } a^{\prime} \text { of } a
$$

4.2 Example We easily see that $\langle U, \cdot\rangle$ and $\left\langle U_{n}, \cdot\right\rangle$ are groups. Multiplication of complex numbers is associative and both $U$ and $U_{n}$ contain 1, which is an identity for multiplication. For $e^{i \theta} \in U$, the computation

$$
e^{i \theta} \cdot e^{i(2 \pi-\theta)}=e^{2 \pi i}=1
$$

shows that every element of $U$ has an inverse. For $z \in U_{n}$, the computation

$$
z \cdot z^{n-1}=z^{n}=1
$$

shows that every element of $U_{n}$ has an inverse. Thus $\langle U, \cdot\rangle$ and $\left\langle U_{n}, \cdot\right\rangle$ are groups. Because $\left\langle\mathbb{R}_{c},{ }_{c}\right\rangle$ is isomorphic to $\langle U, \cdot\rangle$, we see that $\left\langle\mathbb{R}_{c},{ }_{c}\right\rangle$ is a group for all $c \in \mathbb{R}^{+}$. Similarly, the fact that $\left\langle\mathbb{Z}_{n},+_{n}\right\rangle$ is isomorphic to $\left\langle U_{n}, \cdot\right\rangle$ shows that $\left\langle\mathbb{Z}_{n},+_{n}\right\rangle$ is a group for all $n \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}$.

We point out now that we will sometimes be sloppy in notation. Rather than use the binary structure notation $\langle G, *\rangle$ constantly, we often refer to a group $G$, with the understanding that there is of course a binary operation on the set $G$. In the event that clarity demands that we specify an operation $*$ on $G$, we use the phrase "the group $G$

## Historical Note

$\mathrm{T}$ There are three historical roots of the development of abstract group theory evident in the mathematical literature of the nineteenth century: the theory of algebraic equations, number theory, and geometry. All three of these areas used grouptheoretic methods of reasoning, although the methods were considerably more explicit in the first area than in the other two.

One of the central themes of geometry in the nineteenth century was the search for invariants under various types of geometric transformations. Gradually attention became focused on the transformations themselves, which in many cases can be thought of as elements of groups.

In number theory, already in the eighteenth century Leonhard Euler had considered the remainders on division of powers $a^{n}$ by a fixed prime $p$. These remainders have "group" properties. Similarly,
Carl F. Gauss, in his Disquisitiones Arithmeticae (1800), dealt extensively with quadratic forms $a x^{2}+2 b x y+c y^{2}$, and in particular showed that equivalence classes of these forms under composition possessed what amounted to group properties.

Finally, the theory of algebraic equations provided the most explicit prefiguring of the group concept. Joseph-Louis Lagrange (1736-1813) in fact initiated the study of permutations of the roots of an equation as a tool for solving it. These permutations, of course, were ultimately considered as elements of a group.

It was Walther von Dyck (1856-1934) and Heinrich Weber (1842-1913) who in 1882 were able independently to combine the three historical roots and give clear definitions of the notion of an abstract group.
under $*$." For example, we may refer to the groups $\mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{Q}$, and $\mathbb{R}$ under addition rather than write the more tedious $\langle\mathbb{Z},+\rangle,\langle\mathbb{Q},+\rangle$, and $\langle\mathbb{R},+\rangle$. However, we feel free to refer to the group $\mathbb{Z}_{8}$ without specifying the operation.

4.3 Definition A group $G$ is abelian if its binary operation is commutative.

## Historical Note

Commutative groups are called abelian in honor of the Norwegian mathematician Niels Henrik Abel (1802-1829). Abel was interested in the question of solvability of polynomial equations. In a paper written in 1828 , he proved that if all the roots of such an equation can be expressed as rational functions $f, g, \ldots, h$ of one of them, say $x$, and if for any two of these roots, $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, the relation $f(g(x))=g(f(x))$ always holds, then the equation is solvable by radicals. Abel showed that each of these functions in fact permutes the roots of the equation; hence, these functions are elements of the group of permutations of the roots. It was this property of commutativity in these permutation groups associated with solvable equations that led Camille Jordan in his 1870 treatise on algebra to name such groups abelian; the name since then has been applied to commutative groups in general.

Abel was attracted to mathematics as a teenager and soon surpassed all his teachers in Norway. He finally received a government travel grant to study elsewhere in 1825 and proceeded to Berlin, where he befriended August Crelle, the founder of the most influential German mathematical journal. Abel contributed numerous papers to Crelle's Journal during the next several years, including many in the field of elliptic functions, whose theory he created virtually single-handedly. Abel returned to Norway in 1827 with no position and an abundance of debts. He nevertheless continued to write brilliant papers, but died of tuberculosis at the age of 26, two days before Crelle succeeded in finding a university position for him in Berlin.

Let us give some examples of some sets with binary operations that give groups and also of some that do not give groups.

4.4 Example The set $\mathbb{Z}^{+}$under addition is not a group. There is no identity element for + in $\mathbb{Z}^{+}$.

4.5 Example The set of all nonnegative integers (including 0) under addition is still not a group. There is an identity element 0 , but no inverse for 2 .

4.6 Example The familiar additive properties of integers and of rational, real, and complex numbers show that $\mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{Q}, \mathbb{R}$, and $\mathbb{C}$ under addition are abelian groups.

4.7 Example The set $\mathbb{Z}^{+}$under multiplication is not a group. There is an identity 1, but no inverse of 3.

4.8 Example The familiar multiplicative properties of rational, real, and complex numbers show that the sets $\mathbb{Q}^{+}$and $\mathbb{R}^{+}$of positive numbers and the sets $\mathbb{Q}^{*}, \mathbb{R}^{*}$, and $\mathbb{C}^{*}$ of nonzero numbers under multiplication are abelian groups.

4.9 Example The set of all real-valued functions with domain $\mathbb{R}$ under function addition is a group. This group is abelian.

4.10 Example (Linear Algebra) Those who have studied vector spaces should note that the axioms for a vector space $V$ pertaining just to vector addition can be summarized by asserting that $V$ under vector addition is an abelian group.

4.11 Example The set $M_{m \times n}(\mathbb{R})$ of all $m \times n$ matrices under matrix addition is a group. The $m \times n$ matrix with all entries 0 is the identity matrix. This group is abelian.

4.12 Example The set $M_{n}(\mathbb{R})$ of all $n \times n$ matrices under matrix multiplication is not a group. The $n \times n$ matrix with all entries 0 has no inverse.

4.13 Example Show that the subset $S$ of $M_{n}(\mathbb{R})$ consisting of all invertible $n \times n$ matrices under matrix multiplication is a group.

Solution We start by showing that $S$ is closed under matrix multiplication. Let $A$ and $B$ be in $S$, so that both $A^{-1}$ and $B^{-1}$ exist and $A A^{-1}=B B^{-1}=I_{n}$. Then

$$
(A B)\left(B^{-1} A^{-1}\right)=A\left(B B^{-1}\right) A^{-1}=A I_{n} A^{-1}=I_{n},
$$

so that $A B$ is invertible and consequently is also in $S$.

Since matrix multiplication is associative and $I_{n}$ acts as the identity element, and since each element of $S$ has an inverse by definition of $S$, we see that $S$ is indeed a group. This group is not commutative. It is our first example of a nonabelian group.

The group of invertible $n \times n$ matrices described in the preceding example is of fundamental importance in linear algebra. It is the general linear group of degree $n$, and is usually denoted by $G L(n, \mathbb{R})$. Those of you who have studied linear algebra know that a matrix $A$ in $G L(n, \mathbb{R})$ gives rise to an invertible linear transformation $T: \mathbb{R}^{n} \rightarrow$ $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, defined by $T(\mathbf{x})=A \mathbf{x}$, and that conversely, every invertible linear transformation of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ into itself is defined in this fashion by some matrix in $G L(n, \mathbb{R})$. Also, matrix multiplication corresponds to composition of linear transformations. Thus all invertible linear transformations of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ into itself form a group under function composition; this group is usually denoted by $G L\left(\mathbb{R}^{n}\right)$. Of course, $G L(n, \mathbb{R}) \simeq G L\left(\mathbb{R}^{n}\right)$.

4.14 Example $\quad$ Let $*$ be defined on $\mathbb{Q}^{+}$by $a * b=a b / 2$. Then

$$
(a * b) * c=\frac{a b}{2} * c=\frac{a b c}{4},
$$

and likewise

$$
a *(b * c)=a * \frac{b c}{2}=\frac{a b c}{4} .
$$

Thus $*$ is associative. Computation shows that

$$
2 * a=a * 2=a
$$

for all $a \in \mathbb{Q}^{+}$, so 2 is an identity element for $*$. Finally,

$$
a * \frac{4}{a}=\frac{4}{a} * a=2,
$$

so $a^{\prime}=4 / a$ is an inverse for $a$. Hence $\mathbb{Q}^{+}$with the operation $*$ is a group.

## Elementary Properties of Groups

As we proceed to prove our first theorem about groups, we must use Definition 4.1, which is the only thing we know about groups at the moment. The proof of a second theorem can employ both Definition 4.1 and the first theorem; the proof of a third theorem can use the definition and the first two theorems, and so on.

Our first theorem will establish cancellation laws. In real arithmetic, we know that $2 a=2 b$ implies that $a=b$. We need only divide both sides of the equation $2 a=2 b$ by 2 , or equivalently, multiply both sides by $\frac{1}{2}$, which is the multiplicative inverse of 2 . We parrot this proof to establish cancellation laws for any group. Note that we will also use the associative law.

4.15 Theorem If $G$ is a group with binary operation $*$, then the left and right cancellation laws hold in $G$, that is, $a * b=a * c$ implies $b=c$, and $b * a=c * a$ implies $b=c$ for all $a, b, c \in G$.

Proof Suppose $a * b=a * c$. Then by $\mathscr{G}_{3}$, there exists $a^{\prime}$, and

$$
a^{\prime} *(a * b)=a^{\prime} *(a * c)
$$

By the associative law,

$$
\left(a^{\prime} * a\right) * b=\left(a^{\prime} * a\right) * c
$$

By the definition of $a^{\prime}$ in $\mathscr{T}_{3}, a^{\prime} * a=e$, so

$$
e * b=e * c
$$

By the definition of $e$ in $\mathscr{G}_{2}$,

$$
b=c .
$$

Similarly, from $b * a=c * a$ one can deduce that $b=c$ upon multiplication on the right by $a^{\prime}$ and use of the axioms for a group.

Our next proof can make use of Theorem 4.15. We show that a "linear equation" in a group has a unique solution. Recall that we chose our group properties to allow us to find solutions of such equations.

4.16 Theorem If $G$ is a group with binary operation $*$, and if $a$ and $b$ are any elements of $G$, then the linear equations $a * x=b$ and $y * a=b$ have unique solutions $x$ and $y$ in $G$.

Proof First we show the existence of at least one solution by just computing that $a^{\prime} * b$ is a solution of $a * x=b$. Note that

$$
\begin{aligned}
a *\left(a^{\prime} * b\right) & =\left(a * a^{\prime}\right) * b, & & \text { associative law, } \\
& =e * b, & & \text { definition of } a^{\prime}, \\
& =b, & & \text { property of } e .
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus $x=a^{\prime} * b$ is a solution of $a * x=b$. In a similar fashion, $y=b * a^{\prime}$ is a solution of $y * a=b$.

To show uniqueness of $y$, we use the standard method of assuming that we have two solutions, $y_{1}$ and $y_{2}$, so that $y_{1} * a=b$ and $y_{2} * a=b$. Then $y_{1} * a=y_{2} * a$, and by Theorem 4.15, $y_{1}=y_{2}$. The uniqueness of $x$ follows similarly.

Of course, to prove the uniqueness in the last theorem, we could have followed the procedure we used in motivating the definition of a group, showing that if $a * x=b$, then $x=a^{\prime} * b$. However, we chose to illustrate the standard way to prove an object is unique; namely, suppose you have two such objects, and then prove they must be the same. Note that the solutions $x=a^{\prime} * b$ and $y=b * a^{\prime}$ need not be the same unless $*$ is commutative.

Because a group is a special type of binary structure, we know from Theorem 3.13 that the identity $e$ in a group is unique. We state this again as part of the next theorem for easy reference.

4.17 Theorem In a group $G$ with binary operation $*$, there is only one element $e$ in $G$ such that

$$
e * x=x * e=x
$$

for all $x \in G$. Likewise for each $a \in G$, there is only one element $a^{\prime}$ in $G$ such that

$$
a^{\prime} * a=a * a^{\prime}=e
$$

In summary, the identity element and inverse of each element are unique in a group.

Proof Theorem 3.13 shows that an identity element for any binary structure is unique. No use of the group axioms was required to show this.

Turning to the uniqueness of an inverse, suppose that $a \in G$ has inverses $a^{\prime}$ and $a^{\prime \prime}$ so that $a^{\prime} * a=a * a^{\prime}=e$ and $a^{\prime \prime} * a=a * a^{\prime \prime}=e$. Then

$$
a * a^{\prime \prime}=a * a^{\prime}=e
$$

and, by Theorem 4.15,

$$
a^{\prime \prime}=a^{\prime},
$$

so the inverse of $a$ in a group is unique.

Note that in a group $G$, we have

$$
(a * b) *\left(b^{\prime} * a^{\prime}\right)=a *\left(b * b^{\prime}\right) * a^{\prime}=(a * e) * a^{\prime}=a * a^{\prime}=e .
$$

This equation and Theorem 4.17 show that $b^{\prime} * a^{\prime}$ is the unique inverse of $a * b$. That is, $(a * b)^{\prime}=b^{\prime} * a^{\prime}$. We state this as a corollary.

4.18 Corollary Let $G$ be a group. For all $a, b \in G$, we have $(a * b)^{\prime}=b^{\prime} * a^{\prime}$.

For your information, we remark that binary algebraic structures with weaker axioms than those for a group have also been studied quite extensively. Of these weaker structures, the semigroup, a set with an associative binary operation, has perhaps had the most attention. A monoid is a semigroup that has an identity element for the binary operation. Note that every group is both a semigroup and a monoid.

Finally, it is possible to give axioms for a group $\langle G, *\rangle$ that seem at first glance to be weaker, namely:

1. The binary operation $*$ on $G$ is associative.
2. There exists a left identity element $e$ in $G$ such that $e * x=x$ for all $x \in G$.
3. For each $a \in G$, there exists a left inverse $a^{\prime}$ in $G$ such that $a^{\prime} * a=e$.

From this one-sided definition, one can prove that the left identity element is also a right identity element, and a left inverse is also a right inverse for the same element. Thus these axioms should not be called weaker, since they result in exactly the same structures being called groups. It is conceivable that it might be easier in some cases to check these left axioms than to check our two-sided axioms. Of course, by symmetry it is clear that there are also right axioms for a group.

## Finite Groups and Group Tables

All our examples after Example 4.2 have been of infinite groups, that is, groups where the set $G$ has an infinite number of elements. We turn to finite groups, starting with the smallest finite sets.

Since a group has to have at least one element, namely, the identity, a minimal set that might give rise to a group is a one-element set $\{e\}$. The only possible binary operation $*$ on $\{e\}$ is defined by $e * e=e$. The three group axioms hold. The identity element is always its own inverse in every group.

Let us try to put a group structure on a set of two elements. Since one of the elements must play the role of identity element, we may as well let the set be $\{e, a\}$. Let us attempt to find a table for a binary operation $*$ on $\{e, a\}$ that gives a group structure on $\{e, a\}$. When giving a table for a group operation, we shall always list the identity first, as in the following table.

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_01_27_9289ad7bed1dd2e5e553g-048.jpg?height=179&width=201&top_left_y=1626&top_left_x=710)

Since $e$ is to be the identity, so

$$
e * x=x * e=x
$$

for all $x \in\{e, a\}$, we are forced to fill in the table as follows, if $*$ is to give a group:

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_01_27_9289ad7bed1dd2e5e553g-048.jpg?height=187&width=204&top_left_y=2021&top_left_x=711)

Also, $a$ must have an inverse $a^{\prime}$ such that

$$
a * a^{\prime}=a^{\prime} * a=e
$$

In our case, $a^{\prime}$ must be either $e$ or $a$. Since $a^{\prime}=e$ obviously does not work, we must have $a^{\prime}=a$, so we have to complete the table as follows:

| $*$ | $e$ | $a$ |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| $e$ | $e$ | $a$ |
| $a$ | $a$ | $e$ |

All the group axioms are now satisfied, except possibly the associative property. Checking associativity on a case-by-case basis from a table defining an operation can be a very tedious process. However, we know that $\mathbb{Z}_{2}=\{0,1\}$ under addition modulo 2 is a group, and by our arguments, its table must be the one above with $e$ replaced by 0 and $a$ by 1 . Thus the associative property must be satisfied for our table containing $e$ and $a$.

With this example as background, we should be able to list some necessary conditions that a table giving a binary operation on a finite set must satisfy for the operation to give a group structure on the set. There must be one element of the set, which we may as well denote by $e$, that acts as the identity element. The condition $e * x=x$ means that the row of the table opposite $e$ at the extreme left must contain exactly the elements appearing across the very top of the table in the same order. Similarly, the condition $x * e=x$ means that the column of the table under $e$ at the very top must contain exactly the elements appearing at the extreme left in the same order. The fact that every element $a$ has a right and a left inverse means that in the row having $a$ at the extreme left, the element $e$ must appear, and in the column under $a$ at the very top, the $e$ must appear. Thus $e$ must appear in each row and in each column. We can do even better than this, however. By Theorem 4.16, not only the equations $a * x=e$ and $y * a=e$ have unique solutions, but also the equations $a * x=b$ and $y * a=b$. By a similar argument, this means that each element $b$ of the group must appear once and only once in each row and each column of the table.

Suppose conversely that a table for a binary operation on a finite set is such that there is an element acting as identity and that in each row and each column, each element of the set appears exactly once. Then it can be seen that the structure is a group structure if and only if the associative law holds. If a binary operation $*$ is given by a table, the associative law is usually messy to check. If the operation $*$ is defined by some characterizing property of $a * b$, the associative law is often easy to check. Fortunately, this second case turns out to be the one usually encountered.

We saw that there was essentially only one group of two elements in the sense that if the elements are denoted by $e$ and $a$ with the identity element $e$ appearing first, the table must be shown in Table 4.19. Suppose that a set has three elements. As before, we may as well let the set be $\{e, a, b\}$. For $e$ to be an identity element, a binary operation * on this set has to have a table of the form shown in Table 4.20. This leaves four places to be filled in. You can quickly see that Table 4.20 must be completed as shown in Table 4.21 if each row and each column are to contain each element exactly once. Because there was only one way to complete the table and $\mathbb{Z}_{3}=\{0,1,2\}$ under addition modulo 3 is a group, the associative property must hold for our table containing $e, a$, and $b$.

Now suppose that $G^{\prime}$ is any other group of three elements and imagine a table for $G^{\prime}$ with identity element appearing first. Since our filling out of the table for $G=\{e, a, b\}$ could be done in only one way, we see that if we take the table for $G^{\prime}$ and rename the identity $e$, the next element listed $a$, and the last element $b$, the resulting table for $G^{\prime}$ must be the same as the one we had for $G$. As explained in Section 3, this renaming gives an isomorphism of the group $G^{\prime}$ with the group $G$. Definition 3.7 defined the notion of isomorphism and of isomorphic binary structures. Groups are just certain types of binary structures, so the same definition pertains to them. Thus our work above can be summarized by saying that all groups with a single element are isomorphic, all groups with just two elements are isomorphic, and all groups with just three elements are isomorphic. We use the phrase up to isomorphism to express this identification using the equivalence relation $\simeq$. Thus we may say, "There is only one group of three elements, up to isomorphism."

## EXERCISES 4

## Computations

In Exercises 1 through 6, determine whether the binary operation $*$ gives a group structure on the given set. If no group results, give the first axiom in the order $\mathscr{T}_{1}, \mathscr{G}_{2}, \mathscr{T}_{3}$ from Definition 4.1 that does not hold.

1. Let $*$ be defined on $\mathbb{Z}$ by letting $a * b=a b$.
2. Let $*$ be defined on $2 \mathbb{Z}=\{2 n \mid n \in \mathbb{Z}\}$ by letting $a * b=a+b$.
3. Let $*$ be defined on $\mathbb{R}^{+}$by letting $a * b=\sqrt{a b}$.
4. Let $*$ be defined on $\mathbb{Q}$ by letting $a * b=a b$.
5. Let $*$ be defined on the set $\mathbb{R}^{*}$ of nonzero real numbers by letting $a * b=a / b$.
6. Let $*$ be defined on $\mathbb{C}$ by letting $a * b=|a b|$.
7. Give an example of an abelian group $G$ where $G$ has exactly 1000 elements.
8. We can also consider multiplication $\cdot{ }_{n}$ modulo $n$ in $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$. For example, $5 \cdot{ }_{7} 6=2$ in $\mathbb{Z}_{7}$ because $5 \cdot 6=30=$ $4(7)+2$. The set $\{1,3,5,7\}$ with multiplication $\cdot 8$ modulo 8 is a group. Give the table for this group.
9. Show that the group $\langle U, \cdot\rangle$ is not isomorphic to either $\langle\mathbb{R},+\rangle$ or $\left\langle\mathbb{R}^{*}, \cdot\right\rangle$. (All three groups have cardinality $|\mathbb{R}|$.)
10. Let $n$ be a positive integer and let $n \mathbb{Z}=\{n m \mid m \in \mathbb{Z}\}$.

a. Show that $\langle n \mathbb{Z},+\rangle$ is a group.

b. Show that $\langle n \mathbb{Z},+\rangle \simeq\langle\mathbb{Z},+\rangle$.

In Exercises 11 through 18, determine whether the given set of matrices under the specified operation, matrix addition or multiplication, is a group. Recall that a diagonal matrix is a square matrix whose only nonzero entries lie on the main diagonal, from the upper left to the lower right corner. An upper-triangular matrix is a square matrix with only zero entries below the main diagonal. Associated with each $n \times n$ matrix $A$ is a number called the determinant of $A$, denoted by $\operatorname{det}(A)$. If $A$ and $B$ are both $n \times n$ matrices, then $\operatorname{det}(A B)=\operatorname{det}(A) \operatorname{det}(B)$. Also, $\operatorname{det}\left(I_{n}\right)=1$ and $A$ is invertible if and only if $\operatorname{det}(A) \neq 0$.

11. All $n \times n$ diagonal matrices under matrix addition.
12. All $n \times n$ diagonal matrices under matrix multiplication.
13. All $n \times n$ diagonal matrices with no zero diagonal entry under matrix multiplication.
14. All $n \times n$ diagonal matrices with all diagonal entries 1 or -1 under matrix multiplication.
15. All $n \times n$ upper-triangular matrices under matrix multiplication.
16. All $n \times n$ upper-triangular matrices under matrix addition.
17. All $n \times n$ upper-triangular matrices with determinant 1 under matrix multiplication.
18. All $n \times n$ matrices with determinant either 1 or -1 under matrix multiplication.
19. Let $S$ be the set of all real numbers except -1 . Define $*$ on $S$ by

$$
a * b=a+b+a b .
$$

a. Show that $*$ gives a binary operation on $S$.

b. Show that $\langle S, *\rangle$ is a group.

c. Find the solution of the equation $2 * x * 3=7$ in $S$.

20. This exercise shows that there are two nonisomorphic group structures on a set of 4 elements.

Let the set be $\{e, a, b, c\}$, with $e$ the identity element for the group operation. A group table would then have to start in the manner shown in Table 4.22. The square indicated by the question mark cannot be filled in with $a$. It must be filled in either with the identity element $e$ or with an element different from both $e$ and $a$. In this latter case, it is no loss of generality to assume that this element is $b$. If this square is filled in with $e$, the table can then be completed in two ways to give a group. Find these two tables. (You need not check the associative law.) If this square is filled in with $b$, then the table can only be completed in one way to give a group. Find this table. (Again, you need not check the associative law.) Of the three tables you now have, two give isomorphic groups. Determine which two tables these are, and give the one-to-one onto renaming function which is an isomorphism.

a. Are all groups of 4 elements commutative?

b. Which table gives a group isomorphic to the group $U_{4}$, so that we know the binary operation defined by the table is associative?

c. Show that the group given by one of the other tables is structurally the same as the group in Exercise 14 for one particular value of $n$, so that we know that the operation defined by that table is associative also.

21. According to Exercise 12 of Section 2, there are 16 possible binary operations on a set of 2 elements. How many of these give a structure of a group? How many of the 19,683 possible binary operations on a set of 3 elements give a group structure?

## Concepts

22. Consider our axioms $\mathscr{T}_{1}, \mathscr{G}_{2}$, and $\mathscr{T}_{3}$ for a group. We gave them in the order $\mathscr{T}_{1} \mathscr{S}_{2} \mathscr{S}_{3}$. Conceivable other orders to state the axioms are $\mathscr{T}_{1} \mathscr{G}_{3} \mathscr{G}_{2}, \mathscr{T}_{2} \mathscr{T}_{1} \mathscr{T}_{3}, \mathscr{T}_{2} \mathscr{T}_{3} \mathscr{T}_{1}, \mathscr{G}_{3} \mathscr{T}_{1} \mathscr{T}_{2}$, and $\mathscr{T}_{3} \mathscr{T}_{2} \mathscr{T}_{1}$. Of these six possible
orders, exactly three are acceptable for a definition. Which orders are not acceptable, and why? (Remember this. Most instructors ask the student to define a group on at least one test.)

### 4.22 Table

| $*$ | $e$ | $a$ | $b$ | $c$ |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

| $a$ | $a$ | $?$ |  |  |
| $b$ | $b$ |  |  |  |
| $c$ | $c$ |  |  |  |

23. The following "definitions" of a group are taken verbatim, including spelling and punctuation, from papers of students who wrote a bit too quickly and carelessly. Criticize them.

a. A group $G$ is a set of elements together with a binary operation $*$ such that the following conditions are satisfied

$*$ is associative

There exists $e \in G$ such that

$$
e * x=x * e=x=\text { identity. }
$$

$$
a \cdot a^{\prime}=a^{\prime} \cdot a=e
$$

The operation on $G$ is associative.

there is an identity element $(e)$ in $G$.

$$

Fore every element $a$ there exists an element $a^{\prime}$ such that

$$

$$

24. Give a table for a binary operation on the set $\{e, a, b\}$ of three elements satisfying axioms $\mathscr{T}_{2}$ and $\mathscr{G}_{3}$ for a group but not axiom $\mathscr{G}_{1}$.
25. Mark each of the following true or false.

a. A group may have more than one identity element.

b. Any two groups of three elements are isomorphic.

c. In a group, each linear equation has a solution.
d. The proper attitude toward a definition is to memorize it so that you can reproduce it word for word as in the text.

e. Any definition a person gives for a group is correct provided that everything that is a group by that person's definition is also a group by the definition in the text.

f. Any definition a person gives for a group is correct provided he or she can show that everything that satisfies the definition satisfies the one in the text and conversely.

g. Every finite group of at most three elements is abelian.

h. An equation of the form $a * x * b=c$ always has a unique solution in a group.

i. The empty set can be considered a group.

j. Every group is a binary algebraic structure.

## Proof synopsis

We give an example of a proof synopsis. Here is a one-sentence synopsis of the proof that the inverse of an element $a$ in a group $\langle G, *\rangle$ is unique.

Assuming that $a * a^{\prime}=e$ and $a * a^{\prime \prime}=e$, apply the left cancellation law to the equation $a * a^{\prime}=a * a^{\prime \prime}$.

Note that we said "the left cancellation law" and not "Theorem 4.15." We always suppose that our synopsis was given as an explanation given during a conversation at lunch, with no reference to text numbering and as little notation as is practical.

26. Give a one-sentence synopsis of the proof of the left cancellation law in Theorem 4.15.
27. Give at most a two-sentence synopsis of the proof in Theorem 4.16 that an equation $a x=b$ has a unique solution in a group.

## Theory

28. From our intuitive grasp of the notion of isomorphic groups, it should be clear that if $\phi: G \rightarrow G^{\prime}$ is a group isomorphism, then $\phi(e)$ is the identity $e^{\prime}$ of $G^{\prime}$. Recall that Theorem 3.14 gave a proof of this for isomorphic binary structures $\langle S, *\rangle$ and $\left\langle S^{\prime}, *^{\prime}\right\rangle$. Of course, this covers the case of groups.

It should also be intuitively clear that if $a$ and $a^{\prime}$ are inverse pairs in $G$, then $\phi(a)$ and $\phi\left(a^{\prime}\right)$ are inverse pairs in $G^{\prime}$, that is, that $\phi(a)^{\prime}=\phi\left(a^{\prime}\right)$. Give a careful proof of this for a skeptic who can't see the forest for all the trees.

29. Show that if $G$ is a finite group with identity $e$ and with an even number of elements, then there is $a \neq e$ in $G$ such that $a * a=e$.
30. Let $\mathbb{R}^{*}$ be the set of all real numbers except 0 . Define $*$ on $\mathbb{R}^{*}$ by letting $a * b=|a| b$.

a. Show that $*$ gives an associative binary operation on $\mathbb{R}^{*}$.

b. Show that there is a left identity for $*$ and a right inverse for each element in $\mathbb{R}^{*}$.

c. Is $\mathbb{R}^{*}$ with this binary operation a group?

d. Explain the significance of this exercise.

31. If $*$ is a binary operation on a set $S$, an element $x$ of $S$ is an idempotent for $*$ if $x * x=x$. Prove that a group has exactly one idempotent element. (You may use any theorems proved so far in the text.)
32. Show that every group $G$ with identity $e$ and such that $x * x=e$ for all $x \in G$ is abelian. [Hint: Consider $(a * b) *(a * b)$.]
33. Let $G$ be an abelian group and let $c^{n}=c * c * \cdots * c$ for $n$ factors $c$, where $c \in G$ and $n \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}$. Give a mathematical induction proof that $(a * b)^{n}=\left(a^{n}\right) *\left(b^{n}\right)$ for all $a, b \in G$.
34. Let $G$ be a group with a finite number of elements. Show that for any $a \in G$, there exists an $n \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}$such that $a^{n}=e$. See Exercise 33 for the meaning of $a^{n}$. [Hint: Consider $e, a, a^{2}, a^{3}, \ldots, a^{m}$, where $m$ is the number of elements in $G$, and use the cancellation laws.]
35. Show that if $(a * b)^{2}=a^{2} * b^{2}$ for $a$ and $b$ in a group $G$, then $a * b=b * a$. See Exercise 33 for the meaning of $a^{2}$.
36. Let $G$ be a group and let $a, b \in G$. Show that $(a * b)^{\prime}=a^{\prime} * b^{\prime}$ if and only if $a * b=b * a$.
37. Let $G$ be a group and suppose that $a * b * c=e$ for $a, b, c \in G$. Show that $b * c * a=e$ also.
38. Prove that a set $G$, together with a binary operation $*$ on $G$ satisfying the left axioms 1,2 , and 3 given on page 43 , is a group.
39. Prove that a nonempty set $G$, together with an associative binary operation $*$ on $G$ such that

$$
a * x=b \text { and } y * a=b \text { have solutions in } G \text { for all } a, b \in G
$$

is a group. [Hint: Use Exercise 38.]

40. Let $\langle G, \cdot\rangle$ be a group. Consider the binary operation $*$ on the set $G$ defined by

$$
a * b=b \cdot a
$$

for $a, b \in G$. Show that $\langle G, *\rangle$ is a group and that $\langle G, *\rangle$ is actually isomorphic to $\langle G, \cdot\rangle \cdot$ [Hint: Consider the map $\phi$ with $\phi(a)=a^{\prime}$ for $a \in G$.]

41. Let $G$ be a group and let $g$ be one fixed element of $G$. Show that the map $i_{g}$, such that $i_{g}(x)=g x g^{\prime}$ for $x \in G$, is an isomorphism of $G$ with itself.

## SECTION 5 Subgroups

## Notation and Terminology

It is time to explain some conventional notation and terminology used in group theory. Algebraists as a rule do not use a special symbol $*$ to denote a binary operation different from the usual addition and multiplication. They stick with the conventional additive or multiplicative notation and even call the operation addition or multiplication, depending on the symbol used. The symbol for addition is, of course, + , and usually multiplication is denoted by juxtaposition without a dot, if no confusion results. Thus in place of the notation $a * b$, we shall be using either $a+b$ to be read "the sum of $a$ and $b$," or $a b$ to be read "the product of $a$ and $b$." There is a sort of unwritten agreement that the symbol + should be used only to designate commutative operations. Algebraists feel very uncomfortable when they see $a+b \neq b+a$. For this reason, when developing our theory in a general situation where the operation may or may not be commutative, we shall always use multiplicative notation.

Algebraists frequently use the symbol 0 to denote an additive identity element and the symbol 1 to denote a multiplicative identity element, even though they may not be actually denoting the integers 0 and 1 . Of course, if they are also talking about numbers at the same time, so that confusion would result, symbols such as $e$ or $u$ are used as

### 5.1 Table

|  | 1 | $a$ | $b$ |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1 | 1 | $a$ | $b$ |
| $a$ | $a$ | $b$ | 1 |
| $b$ | $b$ | 1 | $a$ |

### 5.2 Table

| + | 0 | $a$ | $b$ |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 0 | 0 | $a$ | $b$ |
| $a$ | $a$ | $b$ | 0 |
| $b$ | $b$ | 0 | $a$ |

identity elements. Thus a table for a group of three elements might be one like Table 5.1 or, since such a group is commutative, the table might look like Table 5.2. In general situations we shall continue to use $e$ to denote the identity element of a group.

It is customary to denote the inverse of an element $a$ in a group by $a^{-1}$ in multiplicative notation and by $-a$ in additive notation. From now on, we shall be using these notations in place of the symbol $a^{\prime}$.

Let $n$ be a positive integer. If $a$ is an element of a group $G$, written multiplicatively, we denote the product $a a a \ldots a$ for $n$ factors $a$ by $a^{n}$. We let $a^{0}$ be the identity element $e$, and denote the product $a^{-1} a^{-1} a^{-1} \ldots a^{-1}$ for $n$ factors by $a^{-n}$. It is easy to see that our usual law of exponents, $a^{m} a^{n}=a^{m+n}$ for $m, n \in \mathbb{Z}$, holds. For $m, n \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}$, it is clear. We illustrate another type of case by an example:

$$
\begin{aligned}
a^{-2} a^{5} & =a^{-1} a^{-1} a a a a a=a^{-1}\left(a^{-1} a\right) a a a a=a^{-1} e a a a a=a^{-1}(e a) a a a \\
& =a^{-1} a a a a=\left(a^{-1} a\right) a a a=e a a a=(e a) a a=a a a=a^{3}
\end{aligned}
$$

In additive notation, we denote $a+a+a+\cdots+a$ for $n$ summands by $n a$, denote $(-a)+(-a)+(-a)+\cdots+(-a)$ for $n$ summands by $-n a$, and let $0 a$ be the identity element. Be careful: In the notation $n a$, the number $n$ is in $\mathbb{Z}$, not in $G$. One reason we prefer to present group theory using multiplicative notation, even if $G$ is abelian, is the confusion caused by regarding $n$ as being in $G$ in this notation $n a$. No one ever misinterprets the $n$ when it appears in an exponent.

Let us explain one more term that is used so often it merits a special definition.

5.3 Definition If $G$ is a group, then the order $|G|$ of $G$ is the number of elements in $G$. (Recall from Section 0 that, for any set $S,|S|$ is the cardinality of $S$.)

## Subsets and Subgroups

You may have noticed that we sometimes have had groups contained within larger groups. For example, the group $\mathbb{Z}$ under addition is contained within the group $\mathbb{Q}$ under addition, which in turn is contained in the group $\mathbb{R}$ under addition. When we view the group $\langle\mathbb{Z},+\rangle$ as contained in the group $\langle\mathbb{R},+\rangle$, it is very important to notice that the operation + on integers $n$ and $m$ as elements of $\langle\mathbb{Z},+\rangle$ produces the same element $n+m$ as would result if you were to think of $n$ and $m$ as elements in $\langle\mathbb{R},+\rangle$. Thus we should not regard the group $\left\langle\mathbb{Q}^{+}, \cdot\right\rangle$ as contained in $\langle\mathbb{R},+\rangle$, even though $\mathbb{Q}^{+}$is contained in $\mathbb{R}$ as a set. In this instance, $2 \cdot 3=6$ in $\left\langle\mathbb{Q}^{+}, \cdot\right\rangle$, while $2+3=5$ in $\langle\mathbb{R},+\rangle$. We are requiring not only that the set of one group be a subset of the set of the other, but also that the group operation on the subset be the induced operation that assigns the same element to each ordered pair from this subset as is assigned by the group operation on the whole set.

5.4 Definition If a subset $H$ of a group $G$ is closed under the binary operation of $G$ and if $H$ with the induced operation from $G$ is itself a group, then $H$ is a subgroup of $G$. We shall let $H \leq G$ or $G \geq H$ denote that $H$ is a subgroup of $G$, and $H<G$ or $G>H$ shall mean $H \leq G$ but $H \neq G$.

Thus $\langle\mathbb{Z},+\rangle<\langle\mathbb{R},+\rangle$ but $\left\langle\mathbb{Q}^{+}, \cdot\right\rangle$ is not a subgroup of $\langle\mathbb{R},+\rangle$, even though as sets, $\mathbb{Q}^{+} \subset \mathbb{R}$. Every group $G$ has as subgroups $G$ itself and $\{e\}$, where $e$ is the identity element of $G$.

5.5 Definition If $G$ is a group, then the subgroup consisting of $G$ itself is the improper subgroup of $G$. All other subgroups are proper subgroups. The subgroup $\{e\}$ is the trivial subgroup of $G$. All other subgroups are nontrivial.

We turn to some illustrations.

5.6 Example $\quad$ Let $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ be the additive group of all $n$-component row vectors with real number entries. The subset consisting of all of these vectors having 0 as entry in the first component is a subgroup of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$.

5.7 Example $\mathbb{Q}^{+}$under multiplication is a proper subgroup of $\mathbb{R}^{+}$under multiplication.

5.8 Example The $n$th roots of unity in $\mathbb{C}$ form a subgroup $U_{n}$ of the group $\mathbb{C}^{*}$ of nonzero complex numbers under multiplication.

5.9 Example There are two different types of group structures of order 4 (see Exercise 20 of Section 4). We describe them by their group tables (Tables 5.10 and 5.11). The group $V$ is the Klein 4-group, and the notation $V$ comes from the German word Vier for four. The group $\mathbb{Z}_{4}$ is isomorphic to the group $U_{4}=\{1, i,-1,-i\}$ of fourth roots of unity under multiplication.

The only nontrivial proper subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}_{4}$ is $\{0,2\}$. Note that $\{0,3\}$ is not a subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}_{4}$, since $\{0,3\}$ is not closed under + . For example, $3+3=2$, and $2 \notin\{0,3\}$. However, the group $V$ has three nontrivial proper subgroups, $\{e, a\},\{e, b\}$, and $\{e, c\}$. Here $\{e, a, b\}$ is not a subgroup, since $\{e, a, b\}$ is not closed under the operation of $V$ because $a b=c$, and $c \notin\{e, a, b\}$.

It is often useful to draw a subgroup diagram of the subgroups of a group. In such a diagram, a line running downward from a group $G$ to a group $H$ means that $H$ is a subgroup of $G$. Thus the larger group is placed nearer the top of the diagram. Figure 5.12 contains the subgroup diagrams for the groups $\mathbb{Z}_{4}$ and $V$ of Example 5.9.

Note that if $H \leq G$ and $a \in H$, then by Theorem 4.16, the equation $a x=a$ must have a unique solution, namely the identity element of $H$. But this equation can also be viewed as one in $G$, and we see that this unique solution must also be the identity element $e$ of $G$. A similar argument then applied to the equation $a x=e$, viewed in both $H$ and $G$, shows that the inverse $a^{-1}$ of $a$ in $G$ is also the inverse of $a$ in the subgroup $H$.

5.13 Example Let $F$ be the group of all real-valued functions with domain $\mathbb{R}$ under addition. The subset of $F$ consisting of those functions that are continuous is a subgroup of $F$, for the sum of continuous functions is continuous, the function $f$ where $f(x)=0$ for all $x$ is continuous and is the additive identity element, and if $f$ is continuous, then $-f$ is continuous.

It is convenient to have routine steps for determining whether a subset of a group $G$ is a subgroup of $G$. Example 5.13 indicates such a routine, and in the next theorem, we demonstrate carefully its validity. While more compact criteria are available, involving only one condition, we prefer this more transparent theorem for a first course.

5.14 Theorem A subset $H$ of a group $G$ is a subgroup of $G$ if and only if

1. $H$ is closed under the binary operation of $G$,
2. the identity element $e$ of $G$ is in $H$,
3. for all $a \in H$ it is true that $a^{-1} \in H$ also.

Proof The fact that if $H \leq G$ then Conditions 1,2, and 3 must hold follows at once from the definition of a subgroup and from the remarks preceding Example 5.13.

Conversely, suppose $H$ is a subset of a group $G$ such that Conditions 1, 2, and 3 hold. By 2 we have at once that $\mathscr{S}_{2}$ is satisfied. Also $\mathscr{S}_{3}$ is satisfied by 3 . It remains to check the associative axiom, $\mathscr{C}_{1}$. But surely for all $a, b, c \in H$ it is true that $(a b) c=a(b c)$ in $H$, for we may actually view this as an equation in $G$, where the associative law holds. Hence $H \leq G$.

5.15 Example Let $F$ be as in Example 5.13. The subset of $F$ consisting of those functions that are differentiable is a subgroup of $F$, for the sum of differentiable functions is differentiable, the constant function 0 is differentiable, and if $f$ is differentiable, then $-f$ is differentiable.

5.16 Example Recall from linear algebra that every square matrix $A$ has associated with it a number $\operatorname{det}(A)$ called its determinant, and that $A$ is invertible if and only if $\operatorname{det}(A) \neq 0$. If $A$ and $B$ are square matrices of the same size, then it can be shown that $\operatorname{det}(A B)=\operatorname{det}(A) \cdot \operatorname{det}(B)$. Let $G$ be the multiplicative group of all invertible $n \times n$ matrices with entries in $\mathbb{C}$ and let $T$ be the subset of $G$ consisting of those matrices with determinant 1. The equation $\operatorname{det}(A B)=\operatorname{det}(A) \cdot \operatorname{det}(B)$ shows that $T$ is closed under matrix multiplication. Recall that the identity matrix $I_{n}$ has determinant 1 . From the equation $\operatorname{det}(A) \cdot \operatorname{det}\left(A^{-1}\right)=$ $\operatorname{det}\left(A A^{-1}\right)=\operatorname{det}\left(I_{n}\right)=1$, we see that if $\operatorname{det}(A)=1$, then $\operatorname{det}\left(A^{-1}\right)=1$. Theorem 5.14 then shows that $T$ is a subgroup of $G$.

## Cyclic Subgroups

Let us see how large a subgroup $H$ of $\mathbb{Z}_{12}$ would have to be if it contains 3 . It would have to contain the identity element 0 and $3+3$, which is 6 . Then it has to contain $6+3$, which is 9 . Note that the inverse of 3 is 9 and the inverse of 6 is 6 . It is easily checked that $H=\{0,3,6,9\}$ is a subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}_{12}$, and it is the smallest subgroup containing 3 .

Let us imitate this reasoning in a general situation. As we remarked before, for a general argument we always use multiplicative notation. Let $G$ be a group and let $a \in G$. A subgroup of $G$ containing $a$ must, by Theorem 5.14, contain $a^{n}$, the result of computing products of $a$ and itself for $n$ factors for every positive integer $n$. These positive integral powers of $a$ do give a set closed under multiplication. It is possible, however, that the inverse of $a$ is not in this set. Of course, a subgroup containing $a$ must also contain $a^{-1}$, and, in general, it must contain $a^{-m}$ for all $m \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}$. It must contain the identity element $e=a^{0}$. Summarizing, a subgroup of $G$ containing the element a must contain all elements $a^{n}$ (or na for additive groups) for all $n \in \mathbb{Z}$. That is, a subgroup containing $a$ must contain $\left\{a^{n} \mid n \in \mathbb{Z}\right\}$. Observe that these powers $a^{n}$ of $a$ need not be distinct. For example, in the group $V$ of Example 5.9,

$$
a^{2}=e, \quad a^{3}=a, \quad a^{4}=e, \quad a^{-1}=a, \quad \text { and so on. }
$$

We have almost proved the next theorem.

5.17 Theorem Let $G$ be a group and let $a \in G$. Then

$$
H=\left\{a^{n} \mid n \in \mathbb{Z}\right\}
$$

is a subgroup of $G$ and is the smallest ${ }^{\dagger}$ subgroup of $G$ that contains $a$, that is, every subgroup containing $a$ contains $H$.[^4]

Part I Groups and Subgroups

Proof We check the three conditions given in Theorem 5.14 for a subset of a group to give a subgroup. Since $a^{r} a^{s}=a^{r+s}$ for $r, s \in \mathbb{Z}$, we see that the product in $G$ of two elements of $H$ is again in $H$. Thus $H$ is closed under the group operation of $G$. Also $a^{0}=e$, so $e \in H$, and for $a^{r} \in H, a^{-r} \in H$ and $a^{-r} a^{r}=e$. Hence all the conditions are satisfied, and $H \leq G$.

Our arguments prior to the statement of the theorem showed that any subgroup of $G$ containing $a$ must contain $H$, so $H$ is the smallest subgroup of $G$ containing $a$.

5.18 Definition Let $G$ be a group and let $a \in G$. Then the subgroup $\left\{a^{n} \mid n \in \mathbb{Z}\right\}$ of $G$, characterized in Theorem 5.17, is called the cyclic subgroup of $\boldsymbol{G}$ generated by $\boldsymbol{a}$, and denoted by $\langle a\rangle$.

5.19 Definition An element $a$ of a group $G$ generates $G$ and is a generator for $G$ if $\langle a\rangle=G$. A group $G$ is cyclic if there is some element $a$ in $G$ that generates $G$.

5.20 Example $\quad$ Let $\mathbb{Z}_{4}$ and $V$ be the groups of Example 5.9. Then $\mathbb{Z}_{4}$ is cyclic and both 1 and 3 are generators, that is,

$$
\langle 1\rangle=\langle 3\rangle=\mathbb{Z}_{4} .
$$

However, $V$ is not cyclic, for $\langle a\rangle,\langle b\rangle$, and $\langle c\rangle$ are proper subgroups of two elements. Of course, $\langle e\rangle$ is the trivial subgroup of one element.

5.21 Example The group $\mathbb{Z}$ under addition is a cyclic group. Both 1 and -1 are generators for this group, and they are the only generators. Also, for $n \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}$, the group $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ under addition modulo $n$ is cyclic. If $n>1$, then both 1 and $n-1$ are generators, but there may be others.

5.22 Example Consider the group $\mathbb{Z}$ under addition. Let us find $\langle 3\rangle$. Here the notation is additive, and $\langle 3\rangle$ must contain

$$
\begin{aligned}
& 3, \quad 3+3=6, \quad 3+3+3=9, \quad \text { and so on, } \\
& 0, \quad-3, \quad-3+-3=-6, \quad-3+-3+-3=-9, \quad \text { and so on. }
\end{aligned}
$$

In other words, the cyclic subgroup generated by 3 consists of all multiples of 3 , positive, negative, and zero. We denote this subgroup by $3 \mathbb{Z}$ as well as $\langle 3\rangle$. In a similar way, we shall let $n \mathbb{Z}$ be the cyclic subgroup $\langle n\rangle$ of $\mathbb{Z}$. Note that $6 \mathbb{Z}<3 \mathbb{Z}$.

5.23 Example For each positive integer $n$, let $U_{n}$ be the multiplicative group of the $n$th roots of unity in $\mathbb{C}$. These elements of $U_{n}$ can be represented geometrically by equally spaced points on a circle about the origin, as illustrated in Fig. 5.24. The heavy point represents the number

$$
\zeta=\cos \frac{2 \pi}{n}+i \sin \frac{2 \pi}{n}
$$

The geometric interpretation of multiplication of complex numbers, explained in Section 1 , shows at once that as $\zeta$ is raised to powers, it works its way counterclockwise around the circle, landing on each of the elements of $U_{n}$ in turn. Thus $U_{n}$ under multiplication is a cyclic group, and $\zeta$ is a generator. The group $U_{n}$ is the cyclic subgroup $\langle\zeta\rangle$ of the group $U$ of all complex numbers $z$, where $|z|=1$, under multiplication.

## Section 6 Cyclic Groups

Recall the following facts and notations from Section 5 . If $G$ is a group and $a \in G$, then

$$
H=\left\{a^{n} \mid n \in \mathbb{Z}\right\}
$$

is a subgroup of $G$ (Theorem 5.17). This group is the cyclic subgroup $\langle a\rangle$ of $G$ generated by $a$. Also, given a group $G$ and an element $a$ in $G$, if

$$
G=\left\{a^{n} \mid n \in \mathbb{Z}\right\}
$$

then $a$ is a generator of $G$ and the group $G=\langle a\rangle$ is cyclic. We introduce one new bit of terminology. Let $a$ be an element of a group $G$. If the cyclic subgroup $\langle a\rangle$ of $G$ is finite, then the order of $a$ is the order $|\langle a\rangle|$ of this cyclic subgroup. Otherwise, we say that $a$ is of infinite order. We will see in this section that if $a \in G$ is of finite order $m$, then $m$ is the smallest positive integer such that $a^{m}=e$.

The first goal of this section is to describe all cyclic groups and all subgroups of cyclic groups. This is not an idle exercise. We will see later that cyclic groups serve as building blocks for all sufficiently small abelian groups, in particular, for all finite abelian groups. Cyclic groups are fundamental to the understanding of groups.

## Elementary Properties of Cyclic Groups

We start with a demonstration that cyclic groups are abelian.

6.1 Theorem Every cyclic group is abelian.

Proof Let $G$ be a cyclic group and let $a$ be a generator of $G$ so that

$$
G=\langle a\rangle=\left\{a^{n} \mid n \in \mathbb{Z}\right\}
$$

If $g_{1}$ and $g_{2}$ are any two elements of $G$, there exist integers $r$ and $s$ such that $g_{1}=a^{r}$ and $g_{2}=a^{s}$. Then

$$
g_{1} g_{2}=a^{r} a^{s}=a^{r+s}=a^{s+r}=a^{s} a^{r}=g_{2} g_{1},
$$

so $G$ is abelian.

We shall continue to use multiplicative notation for our general work on cyclic groups, even though they are abelian.

The division algorithm that follows is a seemingly trivial, but very fundamental tool for the study of cyclic groups.

6.2 Figure

6.3 Division Algorithm for $\mathbb{Z}$ If $m$ is a positive integer and $n$ is any integer, then there exist unique integers $q$ and $r$ such that

$$
n=m q+r \quad \text { and } \quad 0 \leq r<m \text {. }
$$

Proof We give an intuitive diagrammatic explanation, using Fig. 6.2. On the real $x$-axis of analytic geometry, mark off the multiples of $m$ and the position of $n$. Now $n$ falls either on a multiple $q m$ of $m$ and $r$ can be taken as 0 , or $n$ falls between two multiples of $m$. If the latter is the case, let $q m$ be the first multiple of $m$ to the left of $n$. Then $r$ is as shown in Fig. 6.2. Note that $0 \leq r<m$. Uniqueness of $q$ and $r$ follows since if $n$ is not a multiple of $m$ so that we can take $r=0$, then there is a unique multiple $q m$ of $m$ to the left of $n$ and at distance less than $m$ from $n$, as illustrated in Fig. 6.2.

In the notation of the division algorithm, we regard $q$ as the quotient and $r$ as the nonnegative remainder when $n$ is divided by $m$.

6.4 Example Find the quotient $q$ and remainder $r$ when 38 is divided by 7 according to the division algorithm.

Solution The positive multiples of 7 are $7,14,21,28,35,42, \cdots$. Choosing the multiple to leave a nonnegative remainder less than 7 , we write

$$
38=35+3=7(5)+3
$$

so the quotient is $q=5$ and the remainder is $r=3$.

6.5 Example Find the quotient $q$ and remainder $r$ when -38 is divided by 7 according to the division algorithm.

Solution The negative multiples of 7 are $-7,-14,-21,-28,-35,-42, \cdots$. Choosing the multiple to leave a nonnegative remainder less than 7 , we write

$$
-38=-42+4=7(-6)+4
$$

so the quotient is $q=-6$ and the remainder is $r=4$.

We will use the division algorithm to show that a subgroup $H$ of a cyclic group $G$ is also cyclic. Think for a moment what we will have to do to prove this. We will have to
use the definition of a cyclic group since we have proved little about cyclic groups yet. That is, we will have to use the fact that $G$ has a generating element $a$. We must then exhibit, in terms of this generator $a$, some generator $c=a^{m}$ for $H$ in order to show that $H$ is cyclic. There is really only one natural choice for the power $m$ of $a$ to try. Can you guess what it is before you read the proof of the theorem?

6.6 Theorem A subgroup of a cyclic group is cyclic.

Proof Let $G$ be a cyclic group generated by $a$ and let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$. If $H=\{e\}$, then $H=\langle e\rangle$ is cyclic. If $H \neq\{e\}$, then $a^{n} \in H$ for some $n \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}$. Let $m$ be the smallest integer in $\mathbb{Z}^{+}$such that $a^{m} \in H$.

We claim that $c=a^{m}$ generates $H$; that is,

$$
H=\left\langle a^{m}\right\rangle=\langle c\rangle
$$

We must show that every $b \in H$ is a power of $c$. Since $b \in H$ and $H \leq G$, we have $b=a^{n}$ for some $n$. Find $q$ and $r$ such that

$$
n=m q+r \quad \text { for } \quad 0 \leq r<m
$$

in accord with the division algorithm. Then

$$
a^{n}=a^{m q+r}=\left(a^{m}\right)^{q} a^{r},
$$

so

$$
a^{r}=\left(a^{m}\right)^{-q} a^{n} .
$$

Now since $a^{n} \in H, a^{m} \in H$, and $H$ is a group, both $\left(a^{m}\right)^{-q}$ and $a^{n}$ are in $H$. Thus

$$
\left(a^{m}\right)^{-q} a^{n} \in H ; \quad \text { that is, } \quad a^{r} \in H \text {. }
$$

Since $m$ was the smallest positive integer such that $a^{m} \in H$ and $0 \leq r<m$, we must have $r=0$. Thus $n=q m$ and

$$
b=a^{n}=\left(a^{m}\right)^{q}=c^{q},
$$

so $b$ is a power of $c$.

As noted in Examples 5.21 and 5.22, $\mathbb{Z}$ under addition is cyclic and for a positive integer $n$, the set $n \mathbb{Z}$ of all multiples of $n$ is a subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}$ under addition, the cyclic subgroup generated by $n$. Theorem 6.6 shows that these cyclic subgroups are the only subgroups of $\mathbb{Z}$ under addition. We state this as a corollary.

6.7 Corollary The subgroups of $\mathbb{Z}$ under addition are precisely the groups $n \mathbb{Z}$ under addition for $n \in \mathbb{Z}$.

This corollary gives us an elegant way to define the greatest common divisor of two positive integers $r$ and $s$. Exercise 45 shows that $H=\{n r+m s \mid n, m \in \mathbb{Z}\}$ is a subgroup of the group $\mathbb{Z}$ under addition. Thus $H$ must be cyclic and have a generator $d$, which we may choose to be positive.

6.8 Definition Let $r$ and $s$ be two positive integers. The positive generator $d$ of the cyclic group

$$
H=\{n r+m s \mid n, m \in \mathbb{Z}\}
$$

under addition is the greatest common divisor (abbreviated gcd) of $r$ and $s$. We write $d=\operatorname{gcd}(r, s)$.

Note from the definition that $d$ is a divisor of both $r$ and $s$ since both $r=1 r+0 s$ and $s=0 r+1 s$ are in $H$. Since $d \in H$, we can write

$$
d=n r+m s
$$

for some integers $n$ and $m$. We see that every integer dividing both $r$ and $s$ divides the right-hand side of the equation, and hence must be a divisor of $d$ also. Thus $d$ must be the largest number dividing both $r$ and $s$; this accounts for the name given to $d$ in Definition 6.8.

6.9 Example Find the gcd of 42 and 72.

Solution The positive divisors of 42 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, and 42. The positive divisors of 72 are $1,2,3,4,6,8,9,12,18,24,36$, and 72 . The greatest common divisor is 6 . Note that $6=(3)(72)+(-5)(42)$. There is an algorithm for expressing the greatest common divisor $d$ of $r$ and $s$ in the form $d=n r+m s$, but we will not need to make use of it here.

Two positive integers are relatively prime if their gcd is 1 . For example, 12 and 25 are relatively prime. Note that they have no prime factors in common. In our discussion of subgroups of cyclic groups, we will need to know the following:

If $r$ and $s$ are relatively prime and if $r$ divides $s m$, then $r$ must divide $m$.

Let's prove this. If $r$ and $s$ are relatively prime, then we may write

$$
1=a r+b s \quad \text { for some } \quad a, b \in \mathbb{Z}
$$

Multiplying by $m$, we obtain

$$
m=a r m+b s m .
$$

Now $r$ divides both arm and $b s m$ since $r$ divides $s m$. Thus $r$ is a divisor of the right-hand side of this equation, so $r$ must divide $m$.

## The Structure of Cyclic Groups

We can now describe all cyclic groups, up to an isomorphism.

6.10 Theorem Let $G$ be a cyclic group with generator $a$. If the order of $G$ is infinite, then $G$ is isomorphic to $\langle\mathbb{Z},+\rangle$. If $G$ has finite order $n$, then $G$ is isomorphic to $\left\langle\mathbb{Z}_{n},+{ }_{n}\right\rangle$.

Proof

Case I For all positive integers $m, a^{m} \neq e$. In this case we claim that no two distinct exponents $h$ and $k$ can give equal elements $a^{h}$ and $a^{k}$ of $G$. Suppose that $a^{h}=a^{k}$ and say $h>k$. Then

$$
a^{h} a^{-k}=a^{h-k}=e,
$$

contrary to our Case I assumption. Hence every element of $G$ can be expressed as $a^{m}$ for a unique $m \in \mathbb{Z}$. The map $\phi: G \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$ given by $\phi\left(a^{i}\right)=i$ is thus well defined, one to one, and onto $\mathbb{Z}$. Also,

$$
\phi\left(a^{i} a^{j}\right)=\phi\left(a^{i+j}\right)=i+j=\phi\left(a^{i}\right)+\phi\left(a^{j}\right)
$$

so the homomorphism property is satisfied and $\phi$ is an isomorphism.

Case II $a^{m}=e$ for some positive integer $m$. Let $n$ be the smallest positive integer such that $a^{n}=e$. If $s \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $s=n q+r$ for $0 \leq r<n$, then $a^{s}=a^{n q+r}=\left(a^{n}\right)^{q} a^{r}=e^{q} a^{r}=a^{r}$. As in Case 1, if $0<k<h<n$ and $a^{h}=a^{k}$, then $a^{h-k}=e$ and $0<h-k<n$, contradicting our choice of $n$. Thus the elements

$$
a^{0}=e, a, a^{2}, a^{3}, \cdots, a^{n-1}
$$

are all distinct and comprise all elements of $G$. The map $\psi: G \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_{n}$ given by $\psi\left(a^{i}\right)=i$ for $i=0,1,2, \cdots, n-1$ is thus well defined, one to one, and onto $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$. Because $a^{n}=e$, we see that $a^{i} a^{j}=a^{k}$ where $k=i+{ }_{n} j$. Thus

$$
\psi\left(a^{i} a^{j}\right)=i+_{n} j=\psi\left(a^{i}\right)+{ }_{n} \psi\left(a^{j}\right),
$$

so the homomorphism property is satisfied and $\psi$ is an isomorphism.

6.12 Figure

Motivated by our work with $U_{n}$, it is nice to visualize the elements $e=a^{0}, a^{1}, a^{2}, \cdots$, $a^{n-1}$ of a cyclic group of order $n$ as being distributed evenly on a circle (see Fig. 6.11). The element $a^{h}$ is located $h$ of these equal units counterclockwise along the circle, measured from the bottom where $e=a^{0}$ is located. To multiply $a^{h}$ and $a^{k}$ diagrammatically, we start from $a^{h}$ and go $k$ additional units around counterclockwise. To see arithmetically
where we end up, find $q$ and $r$ such that

$$
h+k=n q+r \quad \text { for } \quad 0 \leq r<n \text {. }
$$

The $n q$ takes us all the way around the circle $q$ times, and we then wind up at $a^{r}$.

Figure 6.12 is essentially the same as Fig. 6.11 but with the points labeled with the exponents on the generator. The operation on these exponents is addition modulo $n$.

## Subgroups of Finite Cyclic Groups

We have completed our description of cyclic groups and turn to their subgroups. Corollary 6.7 gives us complete information about subgroups of infinite cyclic groups. Let us give the basic theorem regarding generators of subgroups for the finite cyclic groups.

6.14 Theorem Let $G$ be a cyclic group with $n$ elements and generated by $a$. Let $b \in G$ and let $b=a$. Then $b$ generates a cyclic subgroup $H$ of $G$ containing $n / d$ elements, where $d$ is the greatest common divisor of $n$ and $s$. Also, $\left\langle a^{s}\right\rangle=\left\langle a^{t}\right\rangle$ if and only if $\operatorname{gcd}(s, n)=\operatorname{gcd}(t, n)$.

Proof That $b$ generates a cyclic subgroup $H$ of $G$ is known from Theorem 5.17. We need show only that $H$ has $n / d$ elements. Following the argument of Case II of Theorem 6.10, we see that $H$ has as many elements as the smallest positive power $m$ of $b$ that gives the identity. Now $b=a^{s}$, and $b^{m}=e$ if and only if $\left(a^{s}\right)^{m}=e$, or if and only if $n$ divides $m s$. What is the smallest positive integer $m$ such that $n$ divides $m s$ ? Let $d$ be the ged of $n$ and $s$. Then there exists integers $u$ and $v$ such that

$$
d=u n+v s
$$

Since $d$ divides both $n$ and $s$, we may write

$$
1=u(n / d)+v(s / d)
$$

where both $n / d$ and $s / d$ are integers. This last equation shows that $n / d$ and $s / d$ are relatively prime, for any integer dividing both of them must also divide 1 . We wish to find the smallest positive $m$ such that

$$
\frac{m s}{n}=\frac{m(s / d)}{(n / d)} \text { is an integer. }
$$

From the boxed division property (1), we conclude that $n / d$ must divide $m$, so the smallest such $m$ is $n / d$. Thus the order of $H$ is $n / d$.

Taking for the moment $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ as a model for a cyclic group of order $n$, we see that if $d$ is a divisor of $n$, then the cyclic subgroup $\langle d\rangle$ of $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ had $n / d$ elements, and contains all the positive integers $m$ less than $n$ such that $\operatorname{gcd}(m, n)=d$. Thus there is only one subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ of order $n / d$. Taken with the preceding paragraph, this shows at once that if $a$ is a generator of the cyclic group $G$, then $\left\langle a^{s}\right\rangle=\left\langle a^{t}\right\rangle$ if and only if $\operatorname{gcd}(s, n)=$ $\operatorname{gcd}(t, n)$.

6.15 Example For an example using additive notation, consider $\mathbb{Z}_{12}$, with the generator $a=1$. Since the greatest common divisor of 3 and 12 is $3,3=3 \cdot 1$ generates a subgroup of $\frac{12}{3}=4$ elements, namely

$$
\langle 3\rangle=\{0,3,6,9\} .
$$

Since the $\operatorname{gcd}$ of 8 and 12 is 4,8 generates a subgroup of $\frac{12}{4}=3$ elements, namely,

$$
\langle 8\rangle=\{0,4,8\} .
$$

Since the gcd of 12 and 5 is 1,5 generates a subgroup of $\frac{12}{1}=12$ elements; that is, 5 is a generator of the whole group $\mathbb{Z}_{12}$.

The following corollary follows immediately from Theorem 6.14.

6.16 Corollary If $a$ is a generator of a finite cyclic group $G$ of order $n$, then the other generators of $G$ are the elements of the form $a^{r}$, where $r$ is relatively prime to $n$.

6.17 Example Let us find all subgroups of $\mathbb{Z}_{18}$ and give their subgroup diagram. All subgroups are cyclic. By Corollary 6.16, the elements $1,5,7,11,13$, and 17 are all generators of $\mathbb{Z}_{18}$. Starting with 2,

$$
\langle 2\rangle=\{0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16\} .
$$

is of order 9 and has as generators elements of the form $h 2$, where $h$ is relatively prime to 9 , namely, $h=1,2,4,5,7$, and 8 , so $h 2=2,4,8,10,14$, and 16 . The element 6 of $\langle 2\rangle$ generates $\{0,6,12\}$, and 12 also is a generator of this subgroup.

We have thus far found all subgroups generated by $0,1,2,4,5,6,7,8,10,11,12$, $13,14,16$, and 17 . This leaves just 3,9 , and 15 to consider.

$$
\langle 3\rangle=\{0,3,6,9,12,15\},
$$

and 15 also generates this group of order 6 , since $15=5 \cdot 3$, and the gcd of 5 and 6 is 1 . Finally,

$$
\langle 9\rangle=\{0,9\} .
$$

The subgroup diagram for these subgroups of $\mathbb{Z}_{18}$ is given in Fig. 6.18.

## section 7 Generating Sets And Cayley Digraphs

Let $G$ be a group, and let $a \in G$. We have described the cyclic subgroup $\langle a\rangle$ of $G$, which is the smallest subgroup of $G$ that contains the element $a$. Suppose we want to find as small a subgroup as possible that contains both $a$ and $b$ for another element $b$ in $G$. By Theorem 5.17, we see that any subgroup containing $a$ and $b$ must contain $a^{n}$ and $b^{m}$ for all $m, n \in \mathbb{Z}$, and consequently must contain all finite products of such powers of $a$ and $b$. For example, such an expression might be $a^{2} b^{4} a^{-3} b^{2} a^{5}$. Note that we cannot "simplify" this expression by writing first all powers of $a$ followed by the powers of $b$, since $G$ may not be abelian. However, products of such expressions are again expressions of the same type. Furthermore, $e=a^{0}$ and the inverse of such an expression is again of the same type. For example, the inverse of $a^{2} b^{4} a^{-3} b^{2} a^{5}$ is $a^{-5} b^{-2} a^{3} b^{-4} a^{-2}$. By Theorem 5.14, this shows that all such products of integral powers of $a$ and $b$ form a subgroup of $G$, which surely must be the smallest subgroup containing both $a$ and $b$. We call $a$ and $b$ generators of this subgroup. If this subgroup should be all of $G$, then we say that $\{a, b\}$ generates $G$. Of course, there is nothing sacred about taking just two elements $a, b \in G$. We could have made similar arguments for three, four, or any number of elements of $G$, as long as we take only finite products of their integral powers.

7.1 Example The Klein 4-group $V=\{e, a, b, c\}$ of Example 5.9 is generated by $\{a, b\}$ since $a b=c$. It is also generated by $\{a, c\},\{b, c\}$, and $\{a, b, c\}$. If a group $G$ is generated by a subset $S$, then every subset of $G$ containing $S$ generates $G$.

7.2 Example The group $\mathbb{Z}_{6}$ is generated by $\{1\}$ and $\{5\}$. It is also generated by $\{2,3\}$ since $2+3=5$, so that any subgroup containing 2 and 3 must contain 5 and must therefore be $\mathbb{Z}_{6}$. It is also generated by $\{3,4\},\{2,3,4\},\{1,3\}$, and $\{3,5\}$, but it is not generated by $\{2,4\}$ since $\langle 2\rangle=\{0,2,4\}$ contains 2 and 4 .

We have given an intuitive explanation of the subgroup of a group $G$ generated by a subset of $G$. What follows is a detailed exposition of the same idea approached in another way, namely via intersections of subgroups. After we get an intuitive grasp of a concept, it is nice to try to write it up as neatly as possible. We give a set-theoretic definition and generalize a theorem that was in Exercise 54 of Section 5.

7.3 Definition Let $\left\{S_{i} \mid i \in I\right\}$ be a collection of sets. Here $I$ may be any set of indices. The intersection $\cap_{i \in I} S_{i}$ of the sets $S_{i}$ is the set of all elements that are in all the sets $S_{i}$; that is,

$$
\bigcap_{i \in I} S_{i}=\left\{x \mid x \in S_{i} \text { for all } i \in I\right\}
$$

If $I$ is finite, $I=\{1,2, \ldots, n\}$, we may denote $\cap_{i \in I} S_{i}$ by

$$
S_{1} \cap S_{2} \cap \cdots \cap S_{n}
$$

7.4 Theorem The intersection of some subgroups $H_{i}$ of a group $G$ for $i \in I$ is again a subgroup of $G$.

Proof Let us show closure. Let $a \in \cap_{i \in I} H_{i}$ and $b \in \cap_{i \in I} H_{i}$, so that $a \in H_{i}$ for all $i \in I$ and $b \in H_{i}$ for all $i \in I$. Then $a b \in H_{i}$ for all $i \in I$, since $H_{i}$ is a group. Thus $a b \in \cap_{i \in I} H_{i}$.

Since $H_{i}$ is a subgroup for all $i \in I$, we have $e \in H_{i}$ for all $i \in I$, and hence $e \in \cap_{i \in I} H_{i}$.

Finally, for $a \in \cap_{i \in I} H_{i}$, we have $a \in H_{i}$ for all $i \in I$, so $a^{-1} \in H_{i}$ for all $i \in I$, which implies that $a^{-1} \in \cap_{i \in I} H_{i}$.

Let $G$ be a group and let $a_{i} \in G$ for $i \in I$. There is at least one subgroup of $G$ containing all the elements $a_{i}$ for $i \in I$, namely $G$ is itself. Theorem 7.4 assures us that if we take the intersection of all subgroups of $G$ containing all $a_{i}$ for $i \in I$, we will obtain a subgroup $H$ of $G$. This subgroup $H$ is the smallest subgroup of $G$ containing all the $a_{i}$ for $i \in I$.

7.5 Definition Let $G$ be a group and let $a_{i} \in G$ for $i \in I$. The smallest subgroup of $G$ containing $\left\{a_{i} \mid i \in I\right\}$ is the subgroup generated by $\left\{a_{i} \mid i \in I\right\}$. If this subgroup is all of $G$, then $\left\{a_{i} \mid i \in I\right\}$ generates $G$ and the $a_{i}$ are generators of $G$. If there is a finite set $\left\{a_{i} \mid i \in I\right\}$ that generates $G$, then $G$ is finitely generated.

Note that this definition is consistent with our previous definition of a generator for a cyclic group. Note also that the statement $a$ is a generator of $G$ may mean either that $G=\langle a\rangle$ or that $a$ is a member of a subset of $G$ that generates $G$. The context in which the statement is made should indicate which is intended. Our next theorem gives the structural insight into the subgroup of $G$ generated by $\left\{a_{i} \mid i \in I\right\}$ that we discussed for two generators before Example 7.1.

7.6 Theorem If $G$ is a group and $a_{i} \in G$ for $i \in I$, then the subgroup $H$ of $G$ generated by $\left\{a_{i} \mid i \in I\right\}$ has as elements precisely those elements of $G$ that are finite products of integral powers of the $a_{i}$, where powers of a fixed $a_{i}$ may occur several times in the product.

Proof Let $K$ denote the set of all finite products of integral powers of the $a_{i}$. Then $K \subseteq H$. We need only observe that $K$ is a subgroup and then, since $H$ is the smallest subgroup containing $a_{i}$ for $i \in I$, we will be done. Observe that a product of elements in $K$ is again in $K$. Since $\left(a_{i}\right)^{0}=e$, we have $e \in K$. For every element $k$ in $K$, if we form from the product giving $k$ a new product with the order of the $a_{i}$ reversed and the opposite
sign on all exponents, we have $k^{-1}$, which is thus in $K$. For example,

$$
\left[\left(a_{1}\right)^{3}\left(a_{2}\right)^{2}\left(a_{1}\right)^{-7}\right]^{-1}=\left(a_{1}\right)^{7}\left(a_{2}\right)^{-2}\left(a_{1}\right)^{-3},
$$

For each generating set $S$ of a finite group $G$, there is a directed graph representing the group in terms of the generators in $S$. The term directed graph is usually abbreviated as digraph. These visual representations of groups were devised by Cayley, and are also referred to as Cayley diagrams in the literature.

Intuitively, a digraph consists of a finite number of points, called vertices of the digraph, and some arcs (each with a direction denoted by an arrowhead) joining vertices. In a digraph for a group $G$ using a generating set $S$ we have one vertex, represented by a dot, for each element of $G$. Each generator in $S$ is denoted by one type of arc. We could use different colors for different arc types in pencil and paperwork. Since different colors are not available in our text, we use different style arcs, like solid, dashed, and dotted, to denote different generators. Thus if $S=\{a, b, c\}$ we might denote

With this notation, an occurrence of $x \bullet \longrightarrow y$ in a Cayley digraph means that $x a=y$. That is, traveling an arc in the direction of the arrow indicates that multiplication of the group element at the start of the arc on the right by the generator corresponding to that type of arc yields the group element at the end of the arc. Of course, since we are in a group, we know immediately that $y a^{-1}=x$. Thus traveling an arc in the direction opposite to the arrow corresponds to multiplication on the right by the inverse of the corresponding generator. If a generator in $S$ is its own inverse, it is customary to denote this by omitting the arrowhead from the arc, rather than using a double arrow. For example, if $b^{2}=e$, we might denote $b$ by

7.7 Example Both of the digraphs shown in Fig. 7.8 represent the group $\mathbb{Z}_{6}$ with generating set $S=\{1\}$. Neither the length and shape of an arc nor the angle between arcs has any significance.

7.10 Example

Both of the digraphs shown in Fig. 7.9 represent the group $\mathbb{Z}_{6}$ with generating set $S=$ $\{2,3\}$. Since 3 is its own inverse, there is no arrowhead on the dashed arcs representing 3 . Notice how different these Cayley diagrams look from those in Fig. 7.8 for the same group. The difference is due to the different choice for the set of generators.

Every digraph for a group must satisfy these four properties for the reasons indicated.

## Property

1. The digraph is connected, that is, we can get from any vertex $g$ to any vertex $h$ by traveling along consecutive arcs, starting at $g$ and ending at $h$.
2. At most one arc goes from a vertex $g$ to a vertex $h$.
3. Each vertex $g$ has exactly one arc of each type starting at $g$, and one of each type ending at $g$.
4. If two different sequences of arc types starting from vertex $g$ lead to the same vertex $h$, then those same sequences of arc types starting from any vertex $u$ will lead to the same vertex $v$.

## Reason

Every equation $g x=h$ has a solution in a group.

The solution of $g x=h$ is unique.

For $g \in G$ and each generator $b$ we can compute $g b$, and $\left(g b^{-1}\right) b=g$.

If $g q=h$ and $g r=h$, then $u q=$ $u g^{-1} h=u r$.

It can be shown that, conversely, every digraph satisfying these four properties is a Cayley digraph for some group. Due to the symmetry of such a digraph, we can choose labels like $a, b, c$ for the various arc types, name any vertex $e$ to represent the identity, and name each other vertex by a product of arc labels and their inverses that we can travel to attain that vertex starting from the one that we named $e$. Some finite groups were first constructed (found) using digraphs.

named a vertex $e$, and then named the other vertices as shown. We have a group $\left\{e, a, a^{2}, a^{3}, b, a b, a^{2} b, a^{3} b\right\}$ of eight elements. Note that the vertex that we named $a b$ could equally well be named $b a^{-1}$, the vertex that we named $a^{3}$ could be named $a^{-1}$, etc. It is not hard to compute products of elements in this group. To compute $\left(a^{3} b\right)\left(a^{2} b\right)$, we just start at the vertex labeled $a^{3} b$ and then travel in succession two solid arcs and one dashed arc, arriving at the vertex $a$, so $\left(a^{3} b\right)\left(a^{2} b\right)=a$. In this fashion, we could write out the table for this eight-element group.

## Concepts

11. How can we tell from a Cayley digraph whether or not the corresponding group is commutative?
12. Referring to Exercise 11, determine whether the group corresponding to the Cayley digraph in Fig. 7.11(b) is commutative.
13. Is it obvious from a Cayley digraph of a group whether or not the group is cyclic? [Hint: Look at Fig. 7.9(b).]
14. The large outside triangle in Fig. 7.9(b) exhibits the cyclic subgroup $\{0,2,4\}$ of $\mathbb{Z}_{6}$. Does the smaller inside triangle similarly exhibit a cyclic subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}_{6}$ ? Why or why not?
15. The generating set $S=\{1,2\}$ for $\mathbb{Z}_{6}$ contains more generators than necessary, since 1 is a generator for the group. Nevertheless, we can draw a Cayley digraph for $\mathbb{Z}_{6}$ with this generating set $S$. Draw such a Cayley digraph.
16. Draw a Cayley digraph for $\mathbb{Z}_{8}$ taking as generating set $S=\{2,5\}$.
17. A relation on a set $S$ of generators of a group $G$ is an equation that equates some product of generators and their inverses to the identity $e$ of $G$. For example, if $S=\{a, b\}$ and $G$ is commutative so that $a b=b a$, then one relation is $a b a^{-1} b^{-1}=e$. If, moreover, $b$ is its own inverse, then another relation is $b^{2}=e$.

a. Explain how we can find some relations on $S$ from a Cayley digraph of $G$.

b. Find three relations on the set $S=\{a, b\}$ of generators for the group described by Fig. 7.11(b).

18. Draw digraphs of the two possible structurally different groups of order 4 , taking as small a generating set as possible in each case. You need not label vertices.

## Theory

19. Show that for $n \geq 3$, there exists a nonabelian group with $2 n$ elements that is generated by two elements of order 2.

## section 8 Groups of Permutations

We have seen examples of groups of numbers, like the groups $\mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{Q}$, and $\mathbb{R}$ under addition. We have also introduced groups of matrices, like the group $G L(2, \mathbb{R})$. Each element $A$ of $G L(2, \mathbb{R})$ yields a transformation of the plane $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ into itself; namely, if we regard $\mathbf{x}$ as a 2-component column vector, then $A \mathbf{x}$ is also a 2-component column vector. The group $G L(2, \mathbb{R})$ is typical of many of the most useful groups in that its elements act on things to transform them. Often, an action produced by a group element can be regarded as a function, and the binary operation of the group can be regarded as function composition. In this section, we construct some finite groups whose elements, called permutations, act on finite sets. These groups will provide us with examples of finite nonabelian groups. We shall show that any finite group is structurally the same as some group of permutations. Unfortunately, this result, which sounds very powerful, does not turn out to be particularly useful to us.

You may be familiar with the notion of a permutation of a set as a rearrangement of the elements of the set. Thus for the set $\{1,2,3,4,5\}$, a rearrangement of the elements could be given schematically as in Fig. 8.1, resulting in the new arrangement $\{4,2,5,3,1\}$. Let us think of this schematic diagram in Fig. 8.1 as a function mapping of each element listed in the left column into a single (not necessarily different) element from the same set listed at the right. Thus 1 is carried into 4, 2 is mapped into 2, and so on. Furthermore, to be a permutation of the set, this mapping must be such that each element appears in the right column once and only once. For example, the diagram in Fig. 8.2 does not give a permutation, for 3 appears twice while 1 does not appear at all in the right column. We now define a permutation to be such a mapping.[^5]

| $2 \rightarrow 2$ | $2 \rightarrow 2$ |
| $3 \rightarrow 5$ | $3 \rightarrow 4$ |
| $4 \rightarrow 3$ | $4 \rightarrow 5$ |

8.3 Definition A permutation of a set $A$ is a function $\phi: A \rightarrow A$ that is both one to one and onto.

## Permutation Groups

We now show that function composition $\circ$ is a binary operation on the collection of all permutations of a set $A$. We call this operation permutation multiplication. Let $A$ be a set, and let $\sigma$ and $\tau$ be permutations of $A$ so that $\sigma$ and $\tau$ are both one-to-one functions mapping $A$ onto $A$. The composite function $\sigma \circ \tau$ defined schematically by

$$
A \stackrel{\tau}{\rightarrow} A \stackrel{\sigma}{\rightarrow} A,
$$

gives a mapping of $A$ into $A$. Rather than keep the symbol $\circ$ for permutation multiplication, we will denote $\sigma \circ \tau$ by the juxtaposition $\sigma \tau$, as we have done for general groups. Now $\sigma \tau$ will be a permutation if it is one to one and onto $A$. Remember that the action of $\sigma \tau$ on A must be read in right-to-left order: first apply $\tau$ and then $\sigma$. Let us show that $\sigma \tau$ is one to one. If

$$
(\sigma \tau)\left(a_{1}\right)=(\sigma \tau)\left(a_{2}\right),
$$

then

$$
\sigma\left(\tau\left(a_{1}\right)\right)=\sigma\left(\tau\left(a_{2}\right)\right),
$$

and since $\sigma$ is given to be one to one, we know that $\tau\left(a_{1}\right)=\tau\left(a_{2}\right)$. But then, since $\tau$ is one to one, this gives $a_{1}=a_{2}$. Hence $\sigma \tau$ is one to one. To show that $\sigma \tau$ is onto $A$, let $a \in A$. Since $\sigma$ is onto $A$, there exists $a^{\prime} \in A$ such that $\sigma\left(a^{\prime}\right)=a$. Since $\tau$ is onto $A$, there exists $a^{\prime \prime} \in A$ such that $\tau\left(a^{\prime \prime}\right)=a^{\prime}$. Thus

$$
a=\sigma\left(a^{\prime}\right)=\sigma\left(\tau\left(a^{\prime \prime}\right)\right)=(\sigma \tau)\left(a^{\prime \prime}\right)
$$

so $\sigma \tau$ is onto $A$.

8.4 Example Suppose that

$$
A=\{1,2,3,4,5\}
$$

and that $\sigma$ is the permutation given by Fig. 8.1. We write $\sigma$ in a more standard notation, changing the columns to rows in parentheses and omitting the arrows, as

$$
\sigma=\left(\begin{array}{lllll}
1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\
4 & 2 & 5 & 3 & 1
\end{array}\right)
$$

## Historical Note

$\mathrm{O}$ ne of the earliest recorded studies of permutations occurs in the Sefer Yetsirah, or Book of Creation, written by an unknown Jewish author sometime before the eighth century. The author was interested in counting the various ways in which the letters of the Hebrew alphabet can be arranged. The question was in some sense a mystical one. It was believed that the letters had magical powers; therefore, suitable arrangements could subjugate the forces of nature. The actual text of the Sefer Yetsirah is very sparse: "Two letters build two words, three build six words, four build 24 words, five build 120 , six build 720 , seven build 5040." Interestingly enough, the idea of counting the arrangements of the letters of the alphabet also occurred in Islamic mathematics in the eighth and ninth centuries. By the thirteenth century, in both the Islamic and Hebrew cultures, the abstract idea of a permutation had taken root so that both Abu-l-'

Abbas ibn al-Banna (1256-1321), a mathematician from Marrakech in what is now Morocco, and Levi ben Gerson, a French rabbi, philosopher, and mathematician, were able to give rigorous proofs that the number of permutations of any set of $n$ elements is $n$ !, as well as prove various results about counting combinations.

Levi and his predecessors, however, were concerned with permutations as simply arrangements of a given finite set. It was the search for solutions of polynomial equations that led Lagrange and others in the late eighteenth century to think of permutations as functions from a finite set to itself, the set being that of the roots of a given equation. And it was Augustin-Louis Cauchy (1789-1857) who developed in detail the basic theorems of permutation theory and who introduced the standard notation used in this text.

so that $\sigma(1)=4, \sigma(2)=2$, and so on. Let

$$
\tau=\left(\begin{array}{lllll}
1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\
3 & 5 & 4 & 2 & 1
\end{array}\right)
$$

Then

$$
\sigma \tau=\left(\begin{array}{lllll}
1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\
4 & 2 & 5 & 3 & 1
\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{lllll}
1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\
3 & 5 & 4 & 2 & 1
\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{lllll}
1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\
5 & 1 & 3 & 2 & 4
\end{array}\right) .
$$

For example, multiplying in right-to-left order,

$$
(\sigma \tau)(1)=\sigma(\tau(1))=\sigma(3)=5
$$

We now show that the collection of all permutations of a nonempty set A forms a group under this permutation multiplication.

8.5 Theorem Let $A$ be a nonempty set, and let $S_{A}$ be the collection of all permutations of $A$. Then $S_{A}$ is a group under permutation multiplication.

Proof We have shown that composition of two permutations of $A$ yields a permutation of $A$, so $S_{A}$ is closed under permutation multiplication.

Now permutation multiplication is defined as function composition, and in Section 2, we showed that function composition is associative. Hence $\mathscr{T}_{1}$ is satisfied.

The permutation $\iota$ such that $\iota(a)=a$, for all $a \in A$ acts as identity. Therefore $\mathscr{F}_{2}$ is satisfied.

For a permutation $\sigma$, the inverse function, $\sigma^{-1}$, is the permutation that reverses the direction of the mapping $\sigma$, that is, $\sigma^{-1}(a)$ is the element $a^{\prime}$ of $A$ such that $a=\sigma\left(a^{\prime}\right)$. The existence of exactly one such element $a^{\prime}$ is a consequence of the fact that, as a function, $\sigma$ is both one to one and onto. For each $a \in A$ we have

$$
\iota(a)=a=\sigma\left(a^{\prime}\right)=\sigma\left(\sigma^{-1}(a)\right)=\left(\sigma \sigma^{-1}\right)(a)
$$

and also

$$
\iota\left(a^{\prime}\right)=a^{\prime}=\sigma^{-1}(a)=\sigma^{-1}\left(\sigma\left(a^{\prime}\right)\right)=\left(\sigma^{-1} \sigma\right)\left(a^{\prime}\right)
$$

so that $\sigma^{-1} \sigma$ and $\sigma \sigma^{-1}$ are both the permutation $\iota$. Thus $\mathcal{G}_{3}$ is satisfied.

Warning: Some texts compute a product $\sigma \mu$ of permutations in left-to-right order, so that $(\sigma \mu)(a)=\mu(\sigma(a))$. Thus the permutation they get for $\sigma \mu$ is the one we would get by computing $\mu \sigma$. Exercise 51 asks us to check in two ways that we still get a group. If you refer to another text on this material, be sure to check its order for permutation multiplication.

There was nothing in our definition of a permutation to require that the set $A$ be finite. However, most of our examples of permutation groups will be concerned with permutations of finite sets. Note that the structure of the group $S_{A}$ is concerned only with the number of elements in the set $A$, and not what the elements in $A$ are. If sets $A$ and $B$ have the same cardinality, then $S_{A} \simeq S_{B}$. To define an isomorphism $\phi: S_{A} \rightarrow S_{B}$, we let $f: A \rightarrow B$ be a one-to-one function mapping $A$ onto $B$, which establishes that $A$ and $B$ have the same cardinality. For $\sigma \in S_{A}$, we let $\phi(\sigma)$ be the permutation $\bar{\sigma} \in S_{B}$ such that $\bar{\sigma}(f(a))=f(\sigma(a))$ for all $a \in A$. To illustrate this for $A=\{1,2,3\}$ and $B=\{\#, \$, \%\}$ and the function $f: A \rightarrow B$ defined as

$$
f(1)=\#, \quad f(2)=\$, \quad f(3)=\% \text {, }
$$

$\phi$ maps

$$
\left(\begin{array}{lll}
1 & 2 & 3 \\
3 & 2 & 1
\end{array}\right) \text { into }\left(\begin{array}{lll}
\# & \$ & \% \\
\% & \$ & \#
\end{array}\right)
$$

We simply rename the elements of $A$ in our two-row notation by elements in $B$ using the renaming function $f$, thus renaming elements of $S_{A}$ to be those of $S_{B}$. We can take $\{1,2,3, \cdots, \mathrm{n}\}$ to be a prototype for a finite set $A$ of $n$ elements.

8.6 Definition Let $A$ be the finite set $\{1,2, \cdots, n\}$. The group of all permutations of $A$ is the symmetric group on $n$ letters, and is denoted by $S_{n}$.

Note that $S_{n}$ has $n$ ! elements, where

$$
n !=n(n-1)(n-2) \cdots(3)(2)(1) .
$$

## Two Important Examples

8.7 Example An interesting example for us is the group $S_{3}$ of $3 !=6$ elements. Let the set $A$ be $\{1,2,3\}$. We list the permutations of $A$ and assign to each a subscripted Greek letter for a name.

The reasons for the choice of names will be clear later. Let

$$
\begin{aligned}
\rho_{0} & =\left(\begin{array}{lll}
1 & 2 & 3 \\
1 & 2 & 3
\end{array}\right), & \mu_{1} & =\left(\begin{array}{lll}
1 & 2 & 3 \\
1 & 3 & 2
\end{array}\right), \\
\rho_{1} & =\left(\begin{array}{lll}

\end{array}\right), & \mu_{3} & =\left(\begin{array}{lll}
1 & 2 & 3 \\
2 & 1 & 3
\end{array}\right) .
\end{aligned}
$$

The multiplication table for $S_{3}$ is shown in Table 8.8. Note that this group is not abelian! We have seen that any group of at most 4 elements is abelian. Later we will see that a group of 5 elements is also abelian. Thus $S_{3}$ has minimum order for any nonabelian group.

There is a natural correspondence between the elements of $S_{3}$ in Example 8.7 and the ways in which two copies of an equilateral triangle with vertices 1, 2, and 3 (see Fig. 8.9 can be placed, one covering the other with vertices on top of vertices. For this reason, $S_{3}$ is also the group $D_{3}$ of symmetries of an equilateral triangle. Naively, we used $\rho_{i}$ for rotations and $\mu_{i}$ for mirror images in bisectors of angles. The notation $D_{3}$ stands for the third dihedral group. The $n$th dihedral group $D_{n}$ is the group of symmetries of the regular $n$-gon. See Exercise $44 .^{\dagger}$

Note that we can consider the elements of $S_{3}$ to act on the triangle in Fig. 8.9. See the discussion at the start of this section.

8.10 Example Let us form the dihedral group $D_{4}$ of permutations corresponding to the ways that two copies of a square with vertices $1,2,3$, and 4 can be placed, one covering the other with vertices on top of vertices (see Fig. 8.11). $D_{4}$ will then be the group of symmetries of the square. It is also called the octic group. Again, we choose seemingly arbitrary[^6]

8.13 Figure Subgroup diagram for $D_{4}$.

The table for $D_{4}$ is given in Table 8.12. Note that $D_{4}$ is again nonabelian. This group is simply beautiful. It will provide us with nice examples for many concepts we will introduce in group theory. Look at the lovely symmetries in that table! Finally, we give in Fig. 8.13 the subgroup diagram for the subgroups of $D_{4}$. Look at the lovely symmetries in that diagram!

## Cayley's Theorem

Look at any group table in the text. Note how each row of the table gives a permutation of the set of elements of the group, as listed at the top of the table. Similarly, each column of the table gives a permutation of the group set, as listed at the left of the table. In view of these observations, it is not surprising that at least every finite group $G$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of the group $S_{G}$ of all permutations of $G$. The same is true for infinite groups; Cayley's theorem states that every group is isomorphic to some group consisting of permutations under permutation multiplication. This is a nice and intriguing result, and is a classic of group theory. At first glance, the theorem might seem to be a tool to answer all questions about groups. What it really shows is the generality of groups of permutations. Examining subgroups of all permutation groups $S_{A}$ for sets $A$ of all sizes would be a tremendous task. Cayley's theorem does show that if a counterexample exists to some conjecture we have made about groups, then some group of permutations will provide the counterexample.

We now proceed to the proof of Cayley's theorem, starting with a definition and then a lemma that is important in its own right.

## Historical Note

A rthur Cayley (1821-1895) gave an abstractsounding definition of a group in a paper of

unable to find a suitable teaching post. In 1863 , he finally became a professor at Cambridge. In 1878, 1854: "A set of symbols, $1, \alpha, \beta, \cdots$, all of them different and such that the product of any two of them (no matter in what order) or the product of any one of them into itself, belongs to the set, is said to be a group." He then proceeded to define a group table and note that every line and column of the table "will contain all the symbols $1, \alpha, \beta, \cdots$." Cayley's symbols, however, always represented operations on sets; it does not seem that he was aware of any other kind of group. He noted, for instance, that the four matrix operations $1, \alpha=$ inversion, $\beta=$ transposition, and $\gamma=\alpha \beta$, form, abstractly, the non-cyclic group of four elements. In any case, his definition went unnoticed for a quarter of a century.

This paper of 1854 was one of about 300 written during the 14 years Cayley was practicing law, being he returned to the theory of groups by publishing four papers, in one of which he stated Theorem 8.16 of this text; his "proof" was simply to notice from the group table that multiplication by any group element permuted the group elements. However, he wrote, "this does not in any wise show that the best or the easiest mode of treating the general problem [of finding all groups of a given order] is thus to regard it as a problem of [permutations]. It seems clear that the better course is to consider the general problem in itself."

The papers of 1878 , unlike the earlier one, found a receptive audience; in fact, they were an important influence on Walther von Dyck's 1882 axiomatic definition of an abstract group, the definition that led to the development of abstract group theory.

8.14 Definition Let $f: A \rightarrow B$ be a function and let $H$ be a subset of $A$. The image of $H$ under $f$ is $\{f(h) \mid h \in H\}$ and is denoted by $f[H]$.

8.15 Lemma Let $G$ and $G^{\prime}$ be groups and let $\phi: G \rightarrow G^{\prime}$ be a one-to-one function such that $\phi(x y)=$ $\phi(x) \phi(y)$ for all $x, y \in G$. Then $\phi[G]$ is a subgroup of $G^{\prime}$ and $\phi$ provides an isomorphism of $G$ with $\phi[G]$.

Proof We show the conditions for a subgroup given in Theorem 5.14 are satisfied by $\phi[G]$. Let $x^{\prime}, y^{\prime} \in \phi[G]$. Then there exist $x, y \in G$ such that $\phi(x)=x^{\prime}$ and $\phi(y)=y^{\prime}$. By hypothesis, $\phi(x y)=\phi(x) \phi(y)=x^{\prime} y^{\prime}$, showing that $x^{\prime} y^{\prime} \in \phi[G]$. We have shown that $\phi[G]$ is closed under the operation of $G^{\prime}$.

Let $e^{\prime}$ be the identity of $G^{\prime}$. Then

$$
e^{\prime} \phi(e)=\phi(e)=\phi(e e)=\phi(e) \phi(e)
$$

Cancellation in $G^{\prime}$ shows that $e^{\prime}=\phi(e)$ so $e^{\prime} \in \phi[G]$.

For $x^{\prime} \in \phi[G]$ where $x^{\prime}=\phi(x)$, we have

$$
e^{\prime}=\phi(e)=\phi\left(x x^{-1}\right)=\phi(x) \phi\left(x^{-1}\right)=x^{\prime} \phi\left(x^{-1}\right),
$$

which shows that $x^{\prime-1}=\phi\left(x^{-1}\right) \in \phi[G]$. This completes the demonstration that $\phi[G]$ is a subgroup of $G^{\prime}$.

That $\phi$ provides an isomorphism of $G$ with $\phi[G]$ now follows at once because $\phi$ provides a one-to-one map of $G$ onto $\phi[G]$ such that $\phi(x y)=\phi(x) \phi(y)$ for all $x, y \in G$.

8.16 Theorem (Cayley's Theorem) Every group is isomorphic to a group of permutations.

Proof Let $G$ be a group. We show that $G$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of $S_{G}$. By Lemma 8.15, we need only to define a one-to-one function $\phi: G \rightarrow S_{G}$ such that $\phi(x y)=\phi(x) \phi(y)$ for all $x, y \in G$. For $x \in G$, let $\lambda_{x}: G \rightarrow G$ be defined by $\lambda_{x}(g)=x g$ for all $g \in G$. (We think of $\lambda_{x}$ as performing left multiplication by $x$.) The equation $\lambda_{x}\left(x^{-1} c\right)=x\left(x^{-1} c\right)=c$ for all $c \in G$ shows that $\lambda_{x}$ maps $G$ onto $G$. If $\lambda_{x}(a)=\lambda_{x}(b)$, then $x a=x b$ so $a=b$ by cancellation. Thus $\lambda_{x}$ is also one to one, and is a permutation of $G$. We now define $\phi: G \rightarrow S_{G}$ by defining $\phi(x)=\lambda_{x}$ for all $x \in G$.

To show that $\phi$ is one to one, suppose that $\phi(x)=\phi(y)$. Then $\lambda_{x}=\lambda_{y}$ as functions mapping $G$ into $G$. In particular $\lambda_{x}(e)=\lambda_{y}(e)$, so $x e=y e$ and $x=y$. Thus $\phi$ is one to one. It only remains to show that $\phi(x y)=\phi(x) \phi(y)$, that is, that $\lambda_{x y}=\lambda_{x} \lambda_{y}$. Now for any $g \in G$, we have $\lambda_{x y}(g)=(x y) g$. Permutation multiplication is function composition, so $\left(\lambda_{x} \lambda_{y}\right)(g)=\lambda_{x}\left(\lambda_{y}(g)\right)=\lambda_{x}(y g)=x(y g)$. Thus by associativity, $\lambda_{x y}=\lambda_{x} \lambda_{y}$.

For the proof of the theorem, we could have considered equally well the permutations $\rho_{x}$ of $G$ defined by

$$
\rho_{x}(g)=g x
$$

for $g \in G$. (We can think of $\rho_{x}$ as meaning right multiplication by $x$.) Exercise 52 shows that these permutations form a subgroup of $S_{G}$, again isomorphic to $G$, but provided by
a map $\mu: G \rightarrow S_{G}$ defined by

$$
\mu(x)=\rho_{x^{-1}} .
$$

8.17 Definition The map $\phi$ in the proof of Theorem 8.16 is the left regular representation of $G$, and the map $\mu$ in the preceding comment is the right regular representation of $G$.

8.18 Example Let us compute the left regular representation of the group given by the group table, Table 8.19. By "compute" we mean give the elements for the left regular representation and the group table. Here the elements are

$$
\lambda_{e}=\left(\begin{array}{lll}
e & a & b \\
e & a & b
\end{array}\right), \quad \lambda_{a}=\left(\begin{array}{lll}
e & a & b \\
a & b & e
\end{array}\right), \quad \text { and } \quad \lambda_{b}=\left(\begin{array}{lll}
e & a & b \\
b & e & a
\end{array}\right)
$$

The table for this representation is just like the original table with $x$ renamed $\lambda_{x}$, as seen in Table 8.20. For example,

$$
\lambda_{a} \lambda_{b}=\left(\begin{array}{lll}
e & a & b \\
a & b & e
\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{lll}
e & a & b \\
b & e & a
\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{lll}
e & a & b \\
e & a & b
\end{array}\right)=\lambda_{e}
$$

For a finite group given by a group table, $\rho_{a}$ is the permutation of the elements corresponding to their order in the column under $a$ at the very top, and $\lambda_{a}$ is the permutation corresponding to the order of the elements in the row opposite $a$ at the extreme left. The notations $\rho_{a}$ and $\lambda_{a}$ were chosen to suggest right and left multiplication by $a$, respectively.

## Theory

In Exercises 40 through 43, let $A$ be a set, $B$ a subset of $A$, and let $b$ be one particular element of $B$. Determine whether the given set is sure to be a subgroup of $S_{A}$ under the induced operation. Here $\sigma[B]=\{\sigma(x) \mid x \in B\}$.

44. In analogy with Examples 8.7 and 8.10 , consider a regular plane $n$-gon for $n \geq 3$. Each way that two copies of such an $n$-gon can be placed, with one covering the other, corresponds to a certain permutation of the vertices. The set of these permutations is a group, the $n$th dihedral group $D_{n}$, under permutation multiplication. Find the order of this group $D_{n}$. Argue geometrically that this group has a subgroup having just half as many elements as the whole group has.
45. Consider a cube that exactly fills a certain cubical box. As in Examples 8.7 and 8.10, the ways in which the cube can be placed into the box correspond to a certain group of permutations of the vertices of the cube. This group is the group of rigid motions (or rotations) of the cube. (It should not be confused with the group of symmetries of the figure, which will be discussed in the exercises of Section 12.) How many elements does this group have? Argue geometrically that this group has at least three different subgroups of order 4 and at least four different subgroups of order 3.
46. Show that $S_{n}$ is a nonabelian group for $n \geq 3$.
47. Strengthening Exercise 46, show that if $n \geq 3$, then the only element of $\sigma$ of $S_{n}$ satisfying $\sigma \gamma=\gamma \sigma$ for all $\gamma \in S_{n}$ is $\sigma=\iota$, the identity permutation.
48. Orbits were defined before Exercise 11. Let $a, b \in A$ and $\sigma \in S_{A}$. Show that if $\mathcal{O}_{a, \sigma}$ and $\mathcal{O}_{b, \sigma}$ have an element in common, then $\mathcal{O}_{a, \sigma}=\mathcal{O}_{b, \sigma}$.
49. If $A$ is a set, then a subgroup $H$ of $S_{A}$ is transitive on $A$ if for each $a, b \in A$ there exists $\sigma \in H$ such that $\sigma(a)=b$. Show that if $A$ is a nonempty finite set, then there exists a finite cyclic subgroup $H$ of $S_{A}$ with $|H|=|A|$ that is transitive on $A$.
50. Referring to the definition before Exercise 11 and to Exercise 49, show that for $\sigma \in S_{A},\langle\sigma\rangle$ is transitive on $A$ if and only if $\mathcal{O}_{a, \sigma}=A$ for some $a \in A$.
51. (See the warning on page 78). Let $G$ be a group with binary operation $*$. Let $G^{\prime}$ be the same set as $G$, and define a binary operation $*^{\prime}$ on $G^{\prime}$ by $x *^{\prime} y=y * x$ for all $x, y \in G^{\prime}$.

a. (Intuitive argument that $G^{\prime}$ under $*^{\prime}$ is a group.) Suppose the front wall of your class room were made of transparent glass, and that all possible products $a * b=c$ and all possible instances $a *(b * c)=$
$(a * b) * c$ of the associative property for $G$ under $*$ were written on the wall with a magic marker. What would a person see when looking at the other side of the wall from the next room in front of yours?

b. Show from the mathematical definition of $*^{\prime}$ that $G^{\prime}$ is a group under $*^{\prime}$.

52. Let $G$ be a group. Prove that the permutations $\rho_{a}: G \rightarrow G$, where $\rho_{a}(x)=x a$ for $a \in G$ and $x \in G$, do form a group isomorphic to $G$.
53. A permutation matrix is one that can be obtained from an identity matrix by reordering its rows. If $P$ is an $n \times n$ permutation matrix and $A$ is any $n \times n$ matrix and $C=P A$, then $C$ can be obtained from $A$ by making precisely the same reordering of the rows of $A$ as the reordering of the rows which produced $P$ from $I_{n}$.

a. Show that every finite group of order $n$ is isomorphic to a group consisting of $n \times n$ permutation matrices under matrix multiplication.

b. For each of the four elements $e, a, b$, and $c$ in the Table 5.11 for the group $V$, give a specific $4 \times 4$ matrix that corresponds to it under such an isomorphism.

## section 9 Orbits, Cycles, and the Alternating Groups

## Orbits

Each permutation $\sigma$ of a set $A$ determines a natural partition of $A$ into cells with the property that $a, b \in A$ are in the same cell if and only if $b=\sigma^{n}(a)$ for some $n \in \mathbb{Z}$. We establish this partition using an appropriate equivalence relation:

For $a, b \in A$, let $a \sim b$ if and only if $b=\sigma^{n}(a)$ for some $n \in \mathbb{Z}$.

We now check that $\sim$ defined by Condition (1) is indeed an equivalence relation.

Reflexive Clearly $a \sim a$ since $a=\iota(a)=\sigma^{0}(a)$.

Symmetric If $a \sim b$, then $b=\sigma^{n}(a)$ for some $n \in \mathbb{Z}$. But then $a=\sigma^{-n}(b)$ and $-n \in \mathbb{Z}$, so $b \sim a$.

Transitive Suppose $a \sim b$ and $b \sim c$, then $b=\sigma^{n}(a)$ and $c=\sigma^{m}(b)$ for some $n, m \in \mathbb{Z}$. Substituting, we find that $c=\sigma^{m}\left(\sigma^{n}(a)\right)=\sigma^{n+m}(a)$, so $a \sim c$.

9.1 Definition Let $\sigma$ be a permutation of a set $A$. The equivalence classes in $A$ determined by the equivalence relation (1) are the orbits of $\sigma$.

9.2 Example Since the identity permutation $\iota$ of $A$ leaves each element of $A$ fixed, the orbits of $\iota$ are the one-element subsets of $A$.

9.3 Example Find the orbits of the permutation

$$
\sigma=\left(\begin{array}{llllllll}
1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 \\
3 & 8 & 6 & 7 & 4 & 1 & 5 & 2
\end{array}\right)
$$

in $S_{8}$.

Solution To find the orbit containing 1, we apply $\sigma$ repeatedly, obtaining symbolically

$$
1 \stackrel{\sigma}{\rightarrow} 3 \stackrel{\sigma}{\rightarrow} 6 \stackrel{\sigma}{\rightarrow} 1 \stackrel{\sigma}{\rightarrow} 3 \stackrel{\sigma}{\rightarrow} 6 \stackrel{\sigma}{\rightarrow} 1 \stackrel{\sigma}{\rightarrow} 3 \stackrel{\sigma}{\rightarrow} \cdots
$$

Since $\sigma^{-1}$ would simply reverse the directions of the arrows in this chain, we see that the orbit containing 1 is $\{1,3,6\}$. We now choose an integer from 1 to 8 not in $\{1,3,6\}$, say 2 , and similarly find that the orbit containing 2 is $\{2,8\}$. Finally, we find that the orbit containing 4 is $\{4,7,5\}$. Since these three orbits include all integers from 1 to 8 , we see that the complete list of orbits of $\sigma$ is

$$
\{1,3,6\}, \quad\{2,8\}, \quad\{4,5,7\} .
$$

## Cycles

For the remainder of this section, we consider just permutations of a finite set $A$ of $n$ elements. We may as well suppose that $A=\{1,2,3, \cdots, n\}$ and that we are dealing with elements of the symmetric group $S_{n}$.

Refer back to Example 9.3. The orbits of

$$
\sigma=\left(\begin{array}{llllllll}
1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 \\
3 & 8 & 6 & 7 & 4 & 1 & 5 & 2
\end{array}\right)
$$

are indicated graphically in Fig. 9.4. That is, $\sigma$ acts on each integer from 1 to 8 on one of the circles by carrying it into the next integer on the circle traveled counterclockwise, in the direction of the arrows. For example, the leftmost circle indicates that $\sigma(1)=3, \sigma(3)=6$, and $\sigma(6)=1$. Figure 9.4 is a nice way to visualize the structure of the permutation $\sigma$.

9.5 Figure

9.4 Figure

Each individual circle in Fig. 9.4 also defines, by itself, a permutation in $S_{8}$. For example, the leftmost circle corresponds to the permutation

$$
\mu=\left(\begin{array}{llllllll}
1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 \\
3 & 2 & 6 & 4 & 5 & 1 & 7 & 8
\end{array}\right)
$$

that acts on 1,3 , and 6 just as $\sigma$ does, but leaves the remaining integers 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8 fixed. In summary, $\mu$ has one three-element orbit $\{1,3,6\}$ and five one-element orbits $\{2\},\{4\},\{5\},\{7\}$, and $\{8\}$. Such a permutation, described graphically by a single circle, is called a cycle (for circle). We consider the identity permutation to be a cycle since it can be represented by a circle having only the integer 1, as shown in Fig. 9.5. We now define the term cycle in a mathematically precise way.

9.6 Definition A permutation $\sigma \in S_{n}$ is a cycle if it has at most one orbit containing more than one element. The length of a cycle is the number of elements in its largest orbit.

To avoid the cumbersome notation, as in Eq. (3), for a cycle, we introduce a single-row cyclic notation. In cyclic notation, the cycle in Eq. (3) becomes

$$
\mu=(1,3,6)
$$

We understand by this notation that $\mu$ carries the first number 1 into the second number 3 , the second number 3 into the next number 6 , etc., until finally the last number 6 is carried into the first number 1. An integer not appearing in this notation for $\mu$ is understood to be left fixed by $\mu$. Of course, the set on which $\mu$ acts, which is $\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\}$ in our example, must be made clear by the context.

9.7 Example Working within $S_{5}$, we see that

$$
(1,3,5,4)=\left(\begin{array}{lllll}
1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\
3 & 2 & 5 & 1 & 4
\end{array}\right)
$$

Observe that

$$
(1,3,5,4)=(3,5,4,1)=(5,4,1,3)=(4,1,3,5)
$$

Of course, since cycles are special types of permutations, they can be multiplied just as any two permutations. The product of two cycles need not again be a cycle, however.

Using cyclic notation, we see that the permutation $\sigma$ in Eq. (2) can be written as a product of cycles:

$$
\sigma=\left(\begin{array}{llllllll}
1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 \\
3 & 8 & 6 & 7 & 4 & 1 & 5 & 2
\end{array}\right)=(1,3,6)(2,8)(4,7,5)
$$

These cycles are disjoint, meaning that any integer is moved by at most one of these cycles; thus no one number appears in the notations of two different cycles. Equation (4) exhibits $\sigma$ in terms of its orbits, and is a one-line description of Fig. 9.4. Every permutation in $S_{n}$ can be expressed in a similar fashion as a product of the disjoint cycles corresponding to its orbits. We state this as a theorem and write out the proof.

9.8 Theorem Every permutation $\sigma$ of a finite set is a product of disjoint cycles.

Proof Let $B_{1}, B_{2}, \cdots, B_{r}$ be the orbits of $\sigma$, and let $\mu_{i}$ be the cycle defined by

$$
\mu_{i}(x)= \begin{cases}\sigma(x) & \text { for } x \in B_{i} \\ x & \text { otherwise }\end{cases}
$$

Clearly $\sigma=\mu_{1} \mu_{2} \cdots \mu_{r}$. Since the equivalence-class orbits $B_{1}, B_{2}, \cdots, B$, being distinct equivalence classes, are disjoint, the cycles $\mu_{1}, \mu_{2}, \cdots, \mu_{r}$ are disjoint also.

While permutation multiplication in general is not commutative, it is readily seen that multiplication of disjoint cycles is commutative. Since the orbits of a permutation are unique, the representation of a permutation as a product of disjoint cycles, none of which is the identity permutation, is unique up to the order of the factors.

## Part II Permutations, Cosets, and Direct Products

9.9 Example Consider the permutation

$$
\left(\begin{array}{llllll}
1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 \\
6 & 5 & 2 & 4 & 3 & 1
\end{array}\right)
$$

Let us write it as a product of disjoint cycles. First, 1 is moved to 6 and then 6 to 1 , giving the cycle $(1,6)$. Then 2 is moved to 5 , which is moved to 3 , which is moved to 2 , or $(2,5,3)$. This takes care of all elements but 4 , which is left fixed. Thus

$$
\left(\begin{array}{llllll}
1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 \\
6 & 5 & 2 & 4 & 3 & 1
\end{array}\right)=(1,6)(2,5,3) .
$$

Multiplication of disjoint cycles is commutative, so the order of the factors $(1,6)$ and $(2,5,3)$ is not important.

You should practice multiplying permutations in cyclic notation where the cycles may or may not be disjoint. We give an example and provide further practice in Exercises 7 through 9.

9.10 Example Consider the cycles $(1,4,5,6)$ and $(2,1,5)$ in $S_{6}$. Multiplying, we find that

$$
(1,4,5,6)(2,1,5)=\left(\begin{array}{llllll}
1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 \\
6 & 4 & 3 & 5 & 2 & 1
\end{array}\right)
$$

and

$$
(2,1,5)(1,4,5,6)=\left(\begin{array}{llllll}
1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 \\
4 & 1 & 3 & 2 & 6 & 5
\end{array}\right)
$$

Neither of these permutations is a cycle.

## Even and Odd Permutations

It seems reasonable that every reordering of the sequence $1,2, \ldots, n$ can be achieved by repeated interchange of positions of pairs of numbers. We discuss this a bit more formally.

### 9.11 Definition A cycle of length 2 is a transposition.

Thus a transposition leaves all elements but two fixed, and maps each of these onto the other. A computation shows that

$$
\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \cdots, a_{n}\right)=\left(a_{1}, a_{n}\right)\left(a_{1}, a_{n-1}\right) \cdots\left(a_{1}, a_{3}\right)\left(a_{1}, a_{2}\right) .
$$

Therefore any cycle is a product of transpositions. We then have the following as a corollary to Theorem 9.8.

9.12 Corollary Any permutation of a finite set of at least two elements is a product of transpositions.

Naively, this corollary just states that any rearrangement of $n$ objects can be achieved by successively interchanging pairs of them.

9.13 Example Following the remarks prior to the corollary, we see that $(1,6)(2,5,3)$ is the product $(1,6)(2,3)(2,5)$ of transpositions.

9.14 Example $\quad$ In $S_{n}$ for $n \geq 2$, the identity permutation is the product $(1,2)(1,2)$ of transpositions.

We have seen that every permutation of a finite set with at least two elements is a product of transpositions. The transpositions may not be disjoint, and a representation of the permutation in this way is not unique. For example, we can always insert at the beginning the transposition $(1,2)$ twice, because $(1,2)(1,2)$ is the identity permutation. What is true is that the number of transpositions used to represent a given permutation must either always be even or always be odd. This is an important fact. We will give two proofs. The first uses a property of determinants from linear algebra. The second involves counting orbits and was suggested by David M. Bloom.

9.15 Theorem No permutation in $S_{n}$ can be expressed both as a product of an even number of transpositions and as a product of an odd number of transpositions.

Proof 1 (From We remarked in Section 8 that $S_{A} \simeq S_{B}$ if $A$ and $B$ have the same cardinality. We linear algebra) work with permutations of the $n$ rows of the $n \times n$ identity matrix $I_{n}$, rather than of the numbers $1,2, \ldots, n$. The identity matrix has determinant 1 . Interchanging any two rows of a square matrix changes the sign of the determinant. Let $C$ be a matrix obtained by a permutation $\sigma$ of the rows of $I_{n}$. If $C$ could be obtained from $I_{n}$ by both an even number and an odd number of transpositions of rows, its determinant would have to be both 1 and -1 , which is impossible. Thus $\sigma$ cannot be expressed both as a product of an even number and an odd number of transpositions.

Proof 2 Let $\sigma \in S_{n}$ and let $\tau=(i, j)$ be a transposition in $S_{n}$. We claim that the number of orbits (Counting orbits) of $\sigma$ and of $\tau \sigma$ differ by 1 .

Case I Suppose $i$ and $j$ are in different orbits of $\sigma$. Write $\sigma$ as a product of disjoint cycles, the first of which contains $j$ and the second of which contains $i$, symbolized by the two circles in Fig. 9.16. We may write the product of these two cycles symbolically as

$$
(b, j, \times, \times, \times)(a, i, \times, \times)
$$

where the symbols $\times$ denote possible other elements in these orbits.

9.17 Figure
Computing the product of the first three cycles in $\tau \sigma=(i, j) \sigma$, we obtain

$$
(i, j)(b, j, \times, \times, \times)(a, i, \times, \times)=(a, j, \times, \times, \times, b, i, \times, \times)
$$

The original 2 orbits have been joined to form just one in $\tau \sigma$ as symbolized in Fig. 9.16. Exercise 28 asks us to repeat the computation to show that the same thing happens if either one or both of $i$ and $j$ should be the only element of their orbit in $\sigma$.

Case II Suppose $i$ and $j$ are in the same orbit of $\sigma$. We can then write $\sigma$ as a product of disjoint cycles with the first cycle of the form

$$
(a, i, \times, \times, \times, b, j, \times, \times)
$$

shown symbolically by the circle in Fig. 9.17. Computing the product of the first two cycles in $\tau \sigma=(i, j) \sigma$, we obtain

$$
(i, j)(a, i, \times, \times, \times, b, j, \times, \times)=(a, j, \times, \times)(b, i, \times, \times, \times)
$$

The original single orbit has been split into two as symbolized in Fig. 9.17.

We have shown that the number of orbits of $\tau \sigma$ differs from the number of orbits of $\sigma$ by 1 . The identity permutation $\iota$ has $n$ orbits, because each element is the only member of its orbit. Now the number of orbits of a given permutation $\sigma \in S_{n}$ differs from $n$ by either an even or an odd number, but not both. Thus it is impossible to write

$$
\sigma=\tau_{1} \tau_{2} \tau_{3} \cdots \tau_{m} \iota
$$

where the $\tau_{k}$ are transpositions in two ways, once with $m$ even and once with $m$ odd.

9.18 Definition A permutation of a finite set is even or odd according to whether it can be expressed as a product of an even number of transpositions or the product of an odd number of transpositions, respectively.

9.19 Example The identity permutation $\iota$ in $S_{n}$ is an even permutation since we have $\iota=(1,2)(1,2)$. If $n=1$ so that we cannot form this product, we define $\iota$ to be even. On the other hand, the permutation $(1,4,5,6)(2,1,5)$ in $S_{6}$ can be written as

$$
(1,4,5,6)(2,1,5)=(1,6)(1,5)(1,4)(2,5)(2,1)
$$

which has five transpositions, so this is an odd permutation.

## The Alternating Groups

We claim that for $n \geq 2$, the number of even permutations in $S_{n}$ is the same as the number of odd permutation; that is, $S_{n}$ is split equally and both numbers are ( $n !$ )/2. To show this, let $A_{n}$ be the set of even permutations in $S_{n}$ and let $B_{n}$ be the set of odd permutations for $n \geq 2$. We proceed to define a one-to-one function from $A_{n}$ onto $B_{n}$. This is exactly what is needed to show that $A_{n}$ and $B_{n}$ have the same number of elements.

Let $\tau$ be any fixed transposition in $S_{n}$; it exists since $n \geq 2$. We may as well suppose that $\tau=(1,2)$. We define a function

$$
\lambda_{\tau}: A_{n} \rightarrow B_{n}
$$

by

$$
\lambda_{\tau}(\sigma)=\tau \sigma
$$

that is, $\sigma \in A_{n}$ is mapped into $(1,2) \sigma$ by $\lambda_{\tau}$. Observe that since $\sigma$ is even, the permutation $(1,2) \sigma$ can be expressed as a product of a $(1+$ even number $)$, or odd number, of transpositions, so $(1,2) \sigma$ is indeed in $B_{n}$. If for $\sigma$ and $\mu$ in $A_{n}$ it is true that $\lambda_{\tau}(\sigma)=\lambda_{\tau}(\mu)$, then

$$
(1,2) \sigma=(1,2) \mu \text {, }
$$

and since $S_{n}$ is a group, we have $\sigma=\mu$. Thus $\lambda_{\tau}$ is a one-to-one function. Finally,

$$
\tau=(1,2)=\tau^{-1}
$$

so if $\rho \in B_{n}$, then

$$
\tau^{-1} \rho \in A_{n},
$$

and

$$
\lambda_{\tau}\left(\tau^{-1} \rho\right)=\tau\left(\tau^{-1} \rho\right)=\rho
$$

Thus $\lambda_{\tau}$ is onto $B_{n}$. Hence the number of elements in $A_{n}$ is the same as the number in $B_{n}$ since there is a one-to-one correspondence between the elements of the sets.

Note that the product of two even permutations is again even. Also since $n \geq 2, S_{n}$ has the transposition $(1,2)$ and $\iota=(1,2)(1,2)$ is an even permutation. Finally, note that if $\sigma$ is expressed as a product of transpositions, the product of the same transpositions taken in just the opposite order is $\sigma^{-1}$. Thus if $\sigma$ is an even permutation, $\sigma^{-1}$ must also be even. Referring to Theorem 5.14, we see that we have proved the following statement.

9.20 Theorem If $n \geq 2$, then the collection of all even permutations of $\{1,2,3, \cdots, n\}$ forms a subgroup of order $n ! / 2$ of the symmetric group $S_{n}$.

9.21 Definition The subgroup of $S_{n}$ consisting of the even permutations of $n$ letters is the alternating group $A_{n}$ on $n$ letters.

Both $S_{n}$ and $A_{n}$ are very important groups. Cayley's theorem shows that every finite group $G$ is structurally identical to some subgroup of $S_{n}$ for $n=|G|$. It can be shown that there are no formulas involving just radicals for solution of polynomial equations of degree $n$ for $n \geq 5$. This fact is actually due to the structure of $A_{n}$, surprising as that may seem!

Then show that any transposition is a product of some of these transpositions and use Corollary 9.12]

## SECTION 10 COSETS AND THE THEOREM OF LAGRANGE

You may have noticed that the order of a subgroup $H$ of a finite group $G$ seems always to be a divisor of the order of $G$. This is the theorem of Lagrange. We shall prove it by exhibiting a partition of $G$ into cells, all having the same size as $H$. Thus if there are $r$ such cells, we will have

$$
r(\text { order of } H)=(\text { order of } G)
$$

from which the theorem follows immediately. The cells in the partition will be called cosets of $H$, and they are important in their own right. In Section 14, we will see that if $H$ satisfies a certain property, then each coset can be regarded as an element of a group in a very natural way. We give some indication of such coset groups in this section to help you develop a feel for the topic.

## Cosets

Let $H$ be a subgroup of a group $G$, which may be of finite or infinite order. We exhibit two partitions of $G$ by defining two equivalence relations, $\sim_{L}$ and $\sim_{R}$ on $G$.

10.1 Theorem Let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$. Let the relation $\sim_{L}$ be defined on $G$ by

$$
a \sim_{L} b \quad \text { if and only if } \quad a^{-1} b \in H .
$$

Let $\sim_{R}$ be defined by

$$
a \sim_{R} b \quad \text { if and only if } \quad a b^{-1} \in H .
$$

Then $\sim_{L}$ and $\sim_{R}$ are both equivalence relations on $G$.

Proof We show that $\sim_{L}$ is an equivalence relation, and leave the proof for $\sim_{R}$ to Exercise 26. When reading the proof, notice how we must constantly make use of the fact that $H$ is a subgroup of $G$.

Reflexive Let $a \in G$. Then $a^{-1} a=e$ and $e \in H$ since $H$ is a subgroup. Thus $a \sim_{L} a$.

Symmetric Suppose $a \sim_{L} b$. Then $a^{-1} b \in H$. Since $H$ is a subgroup, $\left(a^{-1} b\right)^{-1}$ is in $H$ and $\left(a^{-1} b\right)^{-1}=b^{-1} a$, so $b^{-1} a$ is in $H$ and $b \sim_{L} a$.

Transitive Let $a \sim_{L} b$ and $b \sim_{L} c$. Then $a^{-1} b \in H$ and $b^{-1} c \in H$. Since $H$ is a subgroup, $\left(a^{-1} b\right)\left(b^{-1} c\right)=a^{-1} c$ is in $H$, so $a \sim_{L} c$.

The equivalence relation $\sim_{L}$ in Theorem 10.1 defines a partition of $G$, as described in Theorem 0.22. Let's see what the cells in this partition look like. Suppose $a \in G$. The cell containing $a$ consists of all $x \in G$ such that $a \sim_{L} x$, which means all $x \in G$ such that $a^{-1} x \in H$. Now $a^{-1} x \in H$ if and only if $a^{-1} x=h$ for some $h \in H$, or equivalently, if and only if $x=a h$ for some $h \in H$. Therefore the cell containing $a$ is $\{a h \mid h \in H\}$, which we denote by $a H$. If we go through the same reasoning for the equivalence relation $\sim_{R}$ defined by $H$, we find the cell in this partition containing $a \in G$ is $H a=\{h a \mid h \in H\}$. Since $G$ need not be abelian, we have no reason to expect $a H$ and $H a$ to be the same subset of $G$. We give a formal definition.

10.2 Definition Let $H$ be a subgroup of a group $G$. The subset $a H=\{a h \mid h \in H\}$ of $G$ is the left coset of $H$ containing $a$, while the subset $H a=\{h a \mid h \in H\}$ is the right coset of $H$ containing $a$.

10.3 Example Exhibit the left cosets and the right cosets of the subgroup $3 \mathbb{Z}$ of $\mathbb{Z}$.

Solution Our notation here is additive, so the left coset of $3 \mathbb{Z}$ containing $m$ is $m+3 \mathbb{Z}$. Taking $m=0$, we see that

$$
3 \mathbb{Z}=\{\cdots,-9,-6,-3,0,3,6,9, \cdots\}
$$

is itself one of its left cosets, the coset containing 0 . To find another left coset, we select an element of $\mathbb{Z}$ not in $3 \mathbb{Z}$, say 1 , and find the left coset containing it. We have

$$
1+3 \mathbb{Z}=\{\cdots,-8,-5,-2,1,4,7,10, \cdots\}
$$

These two left cosets, $3 \mathbb{Z}$ and $1+3 \mathbb{Z}$, do not yet exhaust $\mathbb{Z}$. For example, 2 is in neither of them. The left coset containing 2 is

$$
2+3 \mathbb{Z}=\{\cdots,-7,-4,-1,2,5,8,11, \cdots\}
$$

It is clear that these three left cosets we have found do exhaust $\mathbb{Z}$, so they constitute the partition of $\mathbb{Z}$ into left cosets of $3 \mathbb{Z}$.

Since $\mathbb{Z}$ is abelian, the left coset $m+3 \mathbb{Z}$ and the right coset $3 \mathbb{Z}+m$ are the same, so the partition of $\mathbb{Z}$ into right cosets is the same.

We observe two things from Example 10.3.

For a subgroup $H$ of an abelian group $G$, the partition of $G$ into left cosets of $H$ and the partition into right cosets are the same.

Also, looking back at Examples 0.17 and 0.20 , we see that the equivalence relation $\sim_{R}$ for the subgroup $n \mathbb{Z}$ of $\mathbb{Z}$ is the same as the relation of congruence modulo $n$. Recall that $h \equiv k(\bmod n)$ in $\mathbb{Z}$ if $h-k$ is divisible by $n$. This is the same as saying that $h+(-k)$ is in $n \mathbb{Z}$, which is relation $\sim_{R}$ of Theorem 10.1 in additive notation. Thus the partition of $\mathbb{Z}$ into cosets of $n \mathbb{Z}$ is the partition of $\mathbb{Z}$ into residue classes modulo $n$. For that reason, we often refer to the cells of this partition as cosets modulo $n \mathbb{Z}$. Note that we do not have to specify left or right cosets since they are the same for this abelian group $\mathbb{Z}$.

The group $\mathbb{Z}_{6}$ is abelian. Find the partition of $\mathbb{Z}_{6}$ into cosets of the subgroup $H=\{0,3\}$.

Solution One coset is $\{0,3\}$ itself. The coset containing 1 is $1+\{0,3\}=\{1,4\}$. The coset containing 2 is $2+\{0,3\}=\{2,5\}$. Since $\{0,3\},\{1,4\}$, and $\{2,5\}$ exhaust all of $\mathbb{Z}_{6}$, these are all the cosets.

We point out a fascinating thing that we will develop in detail in Section 14. Referring back to Example 10.4, Table 10.5 gives the binary operation for $\mathbb{Z}_{6}$ but with elements listed in the order they appear in the cosets $\{0,3\},\{1,4\},(2,5\}$. We shaded the table according to these cosets.

Suppose we denote these cosets by LT(light), MD(medium), and DK(dark) according to their shading. Table 10.5 then defines a binary operation on these shadings, as shown in Table 10.6. Note that if we replace LT by 0, MD by 1, and DK by 2 in Table 10.6, we obtain the table for $\mathbb{Z}_{3}$. Thus the table of shadings forms a group! We will see in

Section 14 that for a partition of an abelian group into cosets of a subgroup, reordering the group table according to the elements in the cosets always gives rise to such a coset group.

Table 10.8 again shows Table 8.8 for the symmetric group $S_{3}$ on three letters. Let $H$ be the subgroup $\left\langle\mu_{1}\right\rangle=\left\{\rho_{0}, \mu_{1}\right\}$ of $S_{3}$. Find the partitions of $S_{3}$ into left cosets of $H$, and the partition into right cosets of $H$.

Solution For the partition into left cosets, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
H & =\left\{\rho_{0}, \mu_{1}\right\}, \\
\rho_{1} H & =\left\{\rho_{1} \rho_{0}, \rho_{1} \mu_{1}\right\}=\left\{\rho_{1}, \mu_{3}\right\}, \\
\rho_{2} H & =\left\{\rho_{2} \rho_{0}, \rho_{2} \mu_{1}\right\}=\left\{\rho_{2}, \mu_{2}\right\} .
\end{aligned}
$$

The partition into right cosets is

$$
\begin{aligned}
H & =\left\{\rho_{0}, \mu_{1}\right\}, \\
H \rho_{1} & =\left\{\rho_{0} \rho_{1}, \mu_{1} \rho_{1}\right\}=\left\{\rho_{1}, \mu_{2}\right\}, \\
H \rho_{2} & =\left\{\rho_{0} \rho_{2}, \mu_{1} \rho_{2}\right\}=\left\{\rho_{2}, \mu_{3}\right\} .
\end{aligned}
$$

The partition into left cosets of $H$ is different from the partition into right cosets. For example, the left coset containing $\rho_{1}$ is $\left\{\rho_{1}, \mu_{3}\right\}$, while the right coset containing $\rho_{1}$ is $\left\{\rho_{1}, \mu_{2}\right\}$. This does not surprise us since the group $S_{3}$ is not abelian.

Referring to Example 10.7, Table 10.9 gives permutation multiplication in $S_{3}$. The elements are listed in the order they appear in the left cosets $\left\{\rho_{0}, \mu_{1}\right\},\left\{\rho_{1}, \mu_{3}\right\},\left\{\rho_{2}, \mu_{2}\right\}$ found in that example. Again, we have shaded the table light, medium, and dark according to the coset to which the element belongs. Note the difference between this table and Table 10.5. This time, the body of the table does not split up into $2 \times 2$ blocks opposite and under the shaded cosets at the left and the top, as in Table 10.5 and we don't get a coset group. The product of a light element and a dark one may be either dark or medium.

Table 10.8 is shaded according to the two left cosets of the subgroup $\left\langle\rho_{1}\right\rangle=$ $\left\{\rho_{0}, \rho_{1}, \rho_{2}\right\}$ of $S_{3}$. These are also the two right cosets, even though $S_{3}$ is not abelian.

From Table 10.8 it is clear that we do have a coset group isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ in this case. We will see in Section 14 that the left cosets of a subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ give rise to a coset group precisely when the partition of $G$ into left cosets of $H$ is the same as the partition into right cosets of $H$. In such a case, we may simply speak of the cosets of $H$, omitting the adjective left or right. We discuss coset groups in detail in Section 14, but we think it will be easier for you to understand them then if you experiment a bit with them now. Some of the exercises in this section are designed for such experimentation.

## The Theorem of Lagrange

Let $H$ be a subgroup of a group $G$. We claim that every left coset and every right coset of $H$ have the same number of elements as $H$. We show this by exhibiting a one-to-one map of $H$ onto a left coset $g H$ of $H$ for a fixed element $g$ of $G$. If $H$ is of finite order, this will show that $g H$ has the same number of elements as $H$. If $H$ is infinite, the existence of such a map is taken as the definition for equality of the size of $H$ and the size of $g H$. (See Definition 0.13.)

Our choice for a one-to-one map $\phi: H \rightarrow g H$ is the natural one. Let $\phi(h)=g h$ for each $h \in H$. This map is onto $g H$ by the definition of $g H$ as $\{g h \mid h \in H\}$. To show that it is one to one, suppose that $\phi\left(h_{1}\right)=\phi\left(h_{2}\right)$ for $h_{1}$ and $h_{2}$ in $H$. Then $g h_{1}=g h_{2}$ and by the cancellation law in the group $G$, we have $h_{1}=h_{2}$. Thus $\phi$ is one to one.

Of course, a similar one-to-one map of $H$ onto the right coset $H g$ can be constructed. (See Exercise 27.) We summarize as follows:

Every coset (left or right) of a subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ has the same number of elements as $H$.

We can now prove the theorem of Lagrange.

(Theorem of Lagrange) Let $H$ be a subgroup of a finite group $G$. Then the order of $H$ is a divisor of the order of $G$.

Proof Let $n$ be the order of $G$, and let $H$ have order $m$. The preceding boxed statement shows that every coset of $H$ also has $m$ elements. Let $r$ be the number of cells in the partition of $G$ into left cosets of $H$. Then $n=r m$, so $m$ is indeed a divisor of $n$.

Note that this elegant and important theorem comes from the simple counting of cosets and the number of elements in each coset. Never underestimate results that count something! We continue to derive consequences of Theorem 10.10, which should be regarded as a counting theorem.

10.11 Corollary Every group of prime order is cyclic.

Proof Let $G$ be of prime order $p$, and let $a$ be an element of $G$ different from the identity. Then the cyclic subgroup $\langle a\rangle$ of $G$ generated by $a$ has at least two elements, $a$ and $e$. But by

Theorem 10.10, the order $m \geq 2$ of $\langle a\rangle$ must divide the prime $p$. Thus we must have $m=p$ and $\langle a\rangle=G$, so $G$ is cyclic.

Since every cyclic group of order $p$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$, we see that there is only one group structure, up to isomorphism, of a given prime order $\rho$. Now doesn't this elegant result follow easily from the theorem of Lagrange, a counting theorem? Never underestimate a theorem that counts something. Proving the preceding corollary is a favorite examination question.

10.12 Theorem The order of an element of a finite group divides the order of the group.

Proof Remembering that the order of an element is the same as the order of the cyclic subgroup generated by the element, we see that this theorem follows directly from Theorem 10.10.

10.13 Definition Let $H$ be a subgroup of a group $G$. The number of left cosets of $H$ in $G$ is the index $(G: H)$ of $H$ in $G$.

The index $(G: H)$ just defined may be finite or infinite. If $G$ is finite, then obviously $(G: H)$ is finite and $(G: H)=|G| /|H|$, since every coset of $H$ contains $|H|$ elements. Exercise 35 shows the index $(G: H)$ could be equally well defined as the number of right cosets of $H$ in $G$. We state a basic theorem concerning indices of subgroups, and leave the proof to the exercises (see Exercise 38).

10.14 Theorem Suppose $H$ and $K$ are subgroups of a group $G$ such that $K \leq H \leq G$, and suppose $(H: K)$ and $(G: H)$ are both finite. Then $(G: K)$ is finite, and $(G: K)=(G: H)(H: K)$.

Theorem 10.10 shows that if there is a subgroup $H$ of a finite group $G$, then the order of $H$ divides the order of $G$. Is the converse true? That is, if $G$ is a group of order $n$, and $m$ divides $n$, is there always a subgroup of order $m$ ? We will see in the next section that this is true for abelian groups. However, $A_{4}$ can be shown to have no subgroup of order 6 , which gives a counterexample for nonabelian groups.

## section 11 Direct Products and Finitely Generated Abelian Groups

## Direct Products

Let us take a moment to review our present stockpile of groups. Starting with finite groups, we have the cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$, the symmetric group $S_{n}$, and the alternating group $A_{n}$ for each positive integer $n$. We also have the dihedral groups $D_{n}$ of Section 8 , and the Klein 4-group $V$. Of course we know that subgroups of these groups exist. Turning to infinite groups, we have groups consisting of sets of numbers under the usual addition or multiplication, as, for example, $\mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{R}$, and $\mathbb{C}$ under addition, and their nonzero elements under multiplication. We have the group $U$ of complex numbers of magnitude 1 under multiplication, which is isomorphic to each of the groups $\mathbb{R}_{c}$ under addition modulo $c$, where $c \in \mathbb{R}^{+}$. We also have the group $S_{A}$ of all permutations of an infinite set $A$, as well as various groups formed from matrices.

One purpose of this section is to show a way to use known groups as building blocks to form more groups. The Klein 4-group will be recovered in this way from the cyclic groups. Employing this procedure with the cyclic groups gives us a large class of abelian groups that can be shown to include all possible structure types for a finite abelian group. We start by generalizing Definition 0.4 .

11.1 Definition The Cartesian product of sets $S_{1}, S_{2}, \cdots, S_{n}$ is the set of all ordered $n$-tuples $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \cdots, a_{n}\right)$, where $a_{i} \in S_{i}$ for $i=1,2, \cdots, n$. The Cartesian product is denoted by either

$$
S_{1} \times S_{2} \times \cdots \times S_{n}
$$

or by

$$
\prod_{i=1}^{n} S_{i} .
$$

We could also define the Cartesian product of an infinite number of sets, but the definition is considerably more sophisticated and we shall not need it.

Now let $G_{1}, G_{2}, \cdots, G_{n}$ be groups, and let us use multiplicative notation for all the group operations. Regarding the $G_{i}$ as sets, we can form $\prod_{i=1}^{n} G_{i}$. Let us show that we can make $\prod_{i=1}^{n} G_{i}$ into a group by means of a binary operation of multiplication by
components. Note again that we are being sloppy when we use the same notation for a group as for the set of elements of the group.

11.2 Theorem Let $G_{1}, G_{2}, \cdots, G_{n}$ be groups. For $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \cdots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}, \cdots, b_{n}\right)$ in $\prod_{i=1}^{n} G_{i}$, define $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \cdots, a_{n}\right)\left(b_{1}, b_{2}, \cdots, b_{n}\right)$ to be the element $\left(a_{1} b_{1}, a_{2} b_{2}, \cdots, a_{n} b_{n}\right)$. Then $\prod_{i=1}^{n} G_{i}$ is a group, the direct product of the groups $G_{i}$, under this binary operation.

Proof Note that since $a_{i} \in G_{i}, b_{i} \in G_{i}$, and $G_{i}$ is a group, we have $a_{i} b_{i} \in G_{i}$. Thus the definition of the binary operation on $\prod_{i=1}^{n} G_{i}$ given in the statement of the theorem makes sense; that is, $\prod_{i=1}^{n} G_{i}$ is closed under the binary operation.

The associative law in $\prod_{i=1}^{n} G_{i}$ is thrown back onto the associative law in each component as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\left(a_{1},\right. & \left.a_{2}, \cdots, a_{n}\right)\left[\left(b_{1}, b_{2}, \cdots, b_{n}\right)\left(c_{1}, c_{2}, \cdots, c_{n}\right)\right] \\
& =\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \cdots, a_{n}\right)\left(b_{1} c_{1}, b_{2} c_{2}, \cdots, b_{n} c_{n}\right) \\
& =\left(a_{1}\left(b_{1} c_{1}\right), a_{2}\left(b_{2} c_{2}\right), \cdots, a_{n}\left(b_{n} c_{n}\right)\right) \\
& =\left(\left(a_{1} b_{1}\right) c_{1},\left(a_{2} b_{2}\right) c_{2}, \cdots,\left(a_{n} b_{n}\right) c_{n}\right) \\
& =\left(a_{1} b_{1}, a_{2} b_{2}, \cdots, a_{n} b_{n}\right)\left(c_{1}, c_{2}, \cdots, c_{n}\right) \\
& =\left[\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \cdots, a_{n}\right)\left(b_{1}, b_{2}, \cdots, b_{n}\right)\right]\left(c_{1}, c_{2}, \cdots, c_{n}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

If $e_{i}$ is the identity element in $G_{i}$, then clearly, with multiplication by components, $\left(e_{1}, e_{2}, \cdots, e_{n}\right)$ is an identity in $\prod_{i=1}^{n} G_{i}$. Finally, an inverse of $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \cdots, a_{n}\right)$ is $\left(a_{1}^{-1}, a_{2}^{-1}, \cdots, a_{n}^{-1}\right)$; compute the product by components. Hence $\prod_{i=1}^{n} G_{i}$ is a group.

In the event that the operation of each $G_{i}$ is commutative, we sometimes use additive notation in $\prod_{i=1}^{n} G_{i}$ and refer to $\prod_{i=1}^{n} G_{i}$ as the direct sum of the groups $G_{i}$. The notation $\oplus_{i=1}^{n} G_{i}$ is sometimes used in this case in place of $\prod_{i=1}^{n} G_{i}$, especially with abelian groups with operation + . The direct sum of abelian groups $G_{1}, G_{2}, \cdots, G_{n}$ may be written $G_{1} \oplus G_{2} \oplus \cdots \oplus G_{n}$. We leave to Exercise 46 the proof that a direct product of abelian groups is again abelian.

It is quickly seen that if the $S_{i}$ has $r_{i}$ elements for $i=1, \cdots, n$, then $\prod_{i=1}^{n} S_{i}$ has $r_{1} r_{2} \cdots r_{n}$ elements, for in an $n$-tuple, there are $r_{1}$ choices for the first component from $S_{1}$, and for each of these there are $r_{2}$ choices for the next component from $S_{2}$, and so on.

11.3 Example Consider the group $\mathbb{Z}_{2} \times \mathbb{Z}_{3}$, which has $2 \cdot 3=6$ elements, namely $(0,0),(0,1),(0,2)$, $(1,0),(1,1)$, and $(1,2)$. We claim that $\mathbb{Z}_{2} \times \mathbb{Z}_{3}$ is cyclic. It is only necessary to find a generator. Let us try $(1,1)$. Here the operations in $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_{3}$ are written additively, so we do the same in the direct product $\mathbb{Z}_{2} \times \mathbb{Z}_{3}$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
(1,1) & =(1,1) \\
2(1,1) & =(1,1)+(1,1)=(0,2) \\
3(1,1) & =(1,1)+(1,1)+(1,1)=(1,0) \\
4(1,1) & =3(1,1)+(1,1)=(1,0)+(1,1)=(0,1) \\
5(1,1) & =4(1,1)+(1,1)=(0,1)+(1,1)=(1,2) \\
6(1,1) & =5(1,1)+(1,1)=(1,2)+(1,1)=(0,0)
\end{aligned}
$$

## Part II Permutations, Cosets, and Direct Products

Thus $(1,1)$ generates all of $\mathbb{Z}_{2} \times \mathbb{Z}_{3}$. Since there is, up to isomorphism, only one cyclic group structure of a given order, we see that $\mathbb{Z}_{2} \times \mathbb{Z}_{3}$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_{6}$.

11.4 Example Consider $\mathbb{Z}_{3} \times \mathbb{Z}_{3}$. This is a group of nine elements. We claim that $\mathbb{Z}_{3} \times \mathbb{Z}_{3}$ is not cyclic. Since the addition is by components, and since in $\mathbb{Z}_{3}$ every element added to itself three times gives the identity, the same is true in $\mathbb{Z}_{3} \times \mathbb{Z}_{3}$. Thus no element can generate the group, for a generator added to itself successively could only give the identity after nine summands. We have found another group structure of order 9. A similar argument shows that $\mathbb{Z}_{2} \times \mathbb{Z}_{2}$ is not cyclic. Thus $\mathbb{Z}_{2} \times \mathbb{Z}_{2}$ must be isomorphic to the Klein 4-group.

The preceding examples illustrate the following theorem:

11.5 Theorem The group $\mathbb{Z}_{m} \times \mathbb{Z}_{n}$ is cyclic and is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_{m n}$ if and only if $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime, that is, the gcd of $m$ and $n$ is 1 .

Proof Consider the cyclic subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}_{m} \times \mathbb{Z}_{n}$ generated by $(1,1)$ as described by Theorem 5.17. As our previous work has shown, the order of this cyclic subgroup is the smallest power of $(1,1)$ that gives the identity $(0,0)$. Here taking a power of $(1,1)$ in our additive notation will involve adding $(1,1)$ to itself repeatedly. Under addition by components, the first component $1 \in \mathbb{Z}_{m}$ yields 0 only after $m$ summands, $2 m$ summands, and so on, and the second component $1 \in \mathbb{Z}_{n}$ yields 0 only after $n$ summands, $2 n$ summands, and so on. For them to yield 0 simultaneously, the number of summands must be a multiple of both $m$ and $n$. The smallest number that is a multiple of both $m$ and $n$ will be $m n$ if and only if the gcd of $m$ and $n$ is 1 ; in this case, $(1,1)$ generates a cyclic subgroup of order $m n$, which is the order of the whole group. This shows that $\mathbb{Z}_{m} \times \mathbb{Z}_{n}$ is cyclic of order $m n$, and hence isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_{m n}$ if $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime.

For the converse, suppose that the gcd of $m$ and $n$ is $d>1$. Then $m n / d$ is divisible by both $m$ and $n$. Consequently, for any $(r, s)$ in $\mathbb{Z}_{m} \times \mathbb{Z}_{n}$, we have

$$
\underbrace{(r, s)+(r, s)+\cdots+(r, s)}_{m n / d \text { summands }}=(0,0)
$$

Hence no element $(r, s)$ in $\mathbb{Z}_{m} \times \mathbb{Z}_{n}$ can generate the entire group, so $\mathbb{Z}_{m} \times \mathbb{Z}_{n}$ is not cyclic and therefore not isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_{m n}$.

This theorem can be extended to a product of more than two factors by similar arguments. We state this as a corollary without going through the details of the proof.

11.6 Corollary The group $\prod_{i=1}^{n} \mathbb{Z}_{m_{i}}$ is cyclic and isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_{m_{1} m_{2} \cdots m_{n}}$ if and only if the numbers $m_{i}$ for $i=1, \cdots, n$ are such that the gcd of any two of them is 1 .

11.7 Example The preceding corollary shows that if $n$ is written as a product of powers of distinct prime numbers, as in

$$
n=\left(p_{1}\right)^{n_{1}}\left(p_{2}\right)^{n_{2}} \cdots\left(p_{r}\right)^{n_{r}},
$$

then $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ is isomorphic to

$$
\mathbb{Z}_{\left(p_{1}\right)^{n_{1}}} \times \mathbb{Z}_{\left(p_{2}\right)^{n_{2}}} \times \cdots \times \mathbb{Z}_{\left(p_{r}\right)^{n_{r}}}
$$

In particular, $\mathbb{Z}_{72}$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_{8} \times \mathbb{Z}_{9}$.

We remark that changing the order of the factors in a direct product yields a group isomorphic to the original one. The names of elements have simply been changed via a permutation of the components in the $n$-tuples.

Exercise 47 of Section 6 asked you to define the least common multiple of two positive integers $r$ and $s$ as a generator of a certain cyclic group. It is straightforward to prove that the subset of $\mathbb{Z}$ consisting of all integers that are multiples of both $r$ and $s$ is a subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}$, and hence is a cyclic group. Likewise, the set of all common multiples of $n$ positive integers $r_{1}, r_{2}, \cdots, r_{n}$ is a subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}$, and hence is cyclic.

11.8 Definition Let $r_{1}, r_{2}, \cdots, r_{n}$ be positive integers. Their least common multiple (abbreviated lcm) is the positive generator of the cyclic group of all common multiples of the $r_{i}$, that is, the cyclic group of all integers divisible by each $r_{i}$ for $i=1,2, \cdots, n$.

From Definition 11.8 and our work on cyclic groups, we see that the lcm of $r_{1}, r_{2}, \cdots$, $r_{n}$ is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of each $r_{i}$ for $i=1,2, \cdots, n$, hence the name least common multiple.

11.9 Theorem Let $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \cdots, a_{n}\right) \in \prod_{i=1}^{n} G_{i}$. If $a_{i}$ is of finite order $r_{i}$ in $G_{i}$, then the order of $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \cdots, a_{n}\right)$ in $\prod_{i=1}^{n} G_{i}$ is equal to the least common multiple of all the $r_{i}$.

Proof This follows by a repetition of the argument used in the proof of Theorem 11.5. For a power of $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \cdots, a_{n}\right)$ to give $\left(e_{1}, e_{2}, \cdots, e_{n}\right)$, the power must simultaneously be a multiple of $r_{1}$ so that this power of the first component $a_{1}$ will yield $e_{1}$, a multiple of $r_{2}$, so that this power of the second component $a_{2}$ will yield $e_{2}$, and so on.

11.10 Example Find the order of $(8,4,10)$ in the group $\mathbb{Z}_{12} \times \mathbb{Z}_{60} \times \mathbb{Z}_{24}$.

Solution Since the gcd of 8 and 12 is 4 , we see that 8 is of order $\frac{12}{4}=3$ in $\mathbb{Z}_{12}$. (See Theorem 6.14.) Similarly, we find that 4 is of order 15 in $\mathbb{Z}_{60}$ and 10 is of order 12 in $\mathbb{Z}_{24}$. The lcm of 3,15 , and 12 is $3 \cdot 5 \cdot 4=60$, so $(8,4,10)$ is of order 60 in the group $\mathbb{Z}_{12} \times \mathbb{Z}_{60} \times$ $\mathbb{Z}_{24}$.

11.11 Example The group $\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}_{2}$ is generated by the elements $(1,0)$ and $(0,1)$. More generally, the direct product of $n$ cyclic groups, each of which is either $\mathbb{Z}$ or $\mathbb{Z}_{m}$ for some positive integer $m$, is generated by the $n n$-tuples

$$
(1,0,0, \cdots, 0), \quad(0,1,0, \cdots, 0), \quad(0,0,1, \cdots, 0), \quad \cdots, \quad(0,0,0, \cdots, 1)
$$

Such a direct product might also be generated by fewer elements. For example, $\mathbb{Z}_{3} \times$ $\mathbb{Z}_{4} \times \mathbb{Z}_{35}$ is generated by the single element $(1,1,1)$.

Note that if $\prod_{i=1}^{n} G_{i}$ is the direct product of groups $G_{i}$, then the subset

$$
\bar{G}_{i}=\left\{\left(e_{1}, e_{2}, \cdots, e_{i-1}, a_{i}, e_{i+1}, \cdots, e_{n}\right) \mid a_{i} \in G_{i}\right\}
$$

that is, the set of all $n$-tuples with the identity elements in all places but the $i$ th, is a subgroup of $\prod_{i=1}^{n} G_{i}$. It is also clear that this subgroup $\bar{G}_{i}$ is naturally isomorphic to $G_{i}$; just rename

$$
\left(e_{1}, e_{2}, \cdots, e_{i-1}, a_{i}, e_{i+1}, \cdots, e_{n}\right) \text { by } a_{i} \text {. }
$$

The group $G_{i}$ is mirrored in the $i$ th component of the elements of $\bar{G}_{i}$, and the $e_{j}$ in the other components just ride along. We consider $\prod_{i=1}^{n} G_{i}$ to be the internal direct product of these subgroups $\bar{G}_{i}$. The direct product given by Theorem 11.2 is called the external direct product of the groups $G_{i}$. The terms internal and external, as applied to a direct product of groups, just reflect whether or not (respectively) we are regarding the component groups as subgroups of the product group. We shall usually omit the words external and internal and just say direct product. Which term we mean will be clear from the context.

## Historical Note

Tn his Disquisitiones Arithmeticae, Carl Gauss 1 demonstrated various results in what is today the theory of abelian groups in the context of number theory. Not only did he deal extensively with equivalence classes of quadratic forms, but he also considered residue classes modulo a given integer. Although he noted that results in these two areas were similar, he did not attempt to develop an abstract theory of abelian groups.

In the 1840s, Ernst Kummer in dealing with ideal complex numbers noted that his results were in many respects analogous to those of Gauss. (See the Historical Note in Section 26.) But it was Kummer's student Leopold Kronecker (see the Historical Note in Section 29) who finally realized that an abstract theory could be developed out of the analogies. As he wrote in 1870 , "these principles [from the work of Gauss and Kummer] belong to a more general, abstract realm of ideas. It is therefore appropriate to free their development from all unimportant restrictions, so that one can spare oneself from the necessity of repeating the same argument in different cases. This advantage already appears in the development itself, and the presentation gains in simplicity, if it is given in the most general admissible manner, since the most important features stand out with clarity." Kronecker then proceeded to develop the basic principles of the theory of finite abelian groups and was able to state and prove a version of Theorem 11.12 restricted to finite groups.

## The Structure of Finitely Generated Abelian Groups

Some theorems of abstract algebra are easy to understand and use, although their proofs may be quite technical and time-consuming to present. This is one section in the text where we explain the meaning and significance of a theorem but omit its proof. The meaning of any theorem whose proof we omit is well within our understanding, and we feel we should be acquainted with it. It would be impossible for us to meet some of these fascinating facts in a one-semester course if we were to insist on wading through complete proofs of all theorems. The theorem that we now state gives us complete structural information about all sufficiently small abelian groups, in particular, about all finite abelian groups.

(Fundamental Theorem of Finitely Generated Abelian Groups) Every finitely generated abelian group $G$ is isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic groups in the form

$$
\mathbb{Z}_{\left(p_{1}\right)^{r_{1}}} \times \mathbb{Z}_{\left(p_{2}\right)^{r_{2}}} \times \cdots \times \mathbb{Z}_{\left(p_{n}\right)^{r_{n}}} \times \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} \times \cdots \times \mathbb{Z}
$$

where the $p_{i}$ are primes, not necessarily distinct, and the $r_{i}$ are positive integers. The direct product is unique except for possible rearrangement of the factors; that is, the number (Betti number of $G$ ) of factors $\mathbb{Z}$ is unique and the prime powers $\left(p_{i}\right)^{r_{i}}$ are unique.

Proof The proof is omitted here.

11.13 Example Find all abelian groups, up to isomorphism, of order 360. The phrase up to isomorphism signifies that any abelian group of order 360 should be structurally identical (isomorphic) to one of the groups of order 360 exhibited.

Solution We make use of Theorem 11.12. Since our groups are to be of the finite order 360, no factors $\mathbb{Z}$ will appear in the direct product shown in the statement of the theorem.

First we express 360 as a product of prime powers $2^{3} 3^{2} 5$. Then using Theorem 11.12, we get as possibilities

1. $\mathbb{Z}_{2} \times \mathbb{Z}_{2} \times \mathbb{Z}_{2} \times \mathbb{Z}_{3} \times \mathbb{Z}_{3} \times \mathbb{Z}_{5}$
2. $\mathbb{Z}_{2} \times \mathbb{Z}_{4} \times \mathbb{Z}_{3} \times \mathbb{Z}_{3} \times \mathbb{Z}_{5}$
3. $\mathbb{Z}_{2} \times \mathbb{Z}_{2} \times \mathbb{Z}_{2} \times \mathbb{Z}_{9} \times \mathbb{Z}_{5}$
4. $\mathbb{Z}_{2} \times \mathbb{Z}_{4} \times \mathbb{Z}_{9} \times \mathbb{Z}_{5}$
5. $\mathbb{Z}_{8} \times \mathbb{Z}_{3} \times \mathbb{Z}_{3} \times \mathbb{Z}_{5}$
6. $\mathbb{Z}_{8} \times \mathbb{Z}_{9} \times \mathbb{Z}_{5}$

Thus there are six different abelian groups (up to isomorphism) of order 360 .

## Applications

We conclude this section with a sampling of the many theorems we could now prove regarding abelian groups.

11.14 Definition A group $G$ is decomposable if it is isomorphic to a direct product of two proper nontrivial subgroups. Otherwise $G$ is indecomposable.

11.15 Theorem The finite indecomposable abelian groups are exactly the cyclic groups with order a power of a prime.

Proof Let $G$ be a finite indecomposable abelian group. Then by Theorem 11.12, $G$ is isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic groups of prime power order. Since $G$ is indecomposable, this direct product must consist of just one cyclic group whose order is a power of a prime number.

Conversely, let $p$ be a prime. Then $\mathbb{Z}_{p^{r}}$ is indecomposable, for if $\mathbb{Z}_{p^{r}}$ were isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_{p^{i}} \times \mathbb{Z}_{p^{j}}$, where $i+j=r$, then every element would have an order at most $p^{\max (i, j)}<p^{r}$.

11.16 Theorem If $m$ divides the order of a finite abelian group $G$, then $G$ has a subgroup of order $m$.

Proof By Theorem 11.12, we can think of $G$ as being

$$
\mathbb{Z}_{\left(p_{1}\right)^{r_{1}}} \times \mathbb{Z}_{\left(p_{2}\right)^{r_{2}}} \times \cdots \times \mathbb{Z}_{\left(p_{n}\right)^{r_{n}}},
$$

where not all primes $p_{i}$ need be distinct. Since $\left(p_{1}\right)^{r_{1}}\left(p_{2}\right)^{r_{2}} \cdots\left(p_{n}\right)^{r_{n}}$ is the order of $G$, then $m$ must be of the form $\left(p_{1}\right)^{s_{1}}\left(p_{2}\right)^{s_{2}} \cdots\left(p_{n}\right)^{s_{n}}$, where $0 \leq s_{i} \leq r_{i}$. By Theorem 6.14, $\left(p_{i}\right)^{r_{i}-s_{i}}$ generates a cyclic subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}_{\left(p_{i}\right)^{r_{i}}}$ of order equal to the quotient of $\left(p_{i}\right)^{r_{i}}$ by the $\operatorname{gcd}$ of $\left(p_{i}\right)^{r_{i}}$ and $\left(p_{i}\right)^{r_{i}-s_{i}}$. But the $\operatorname{gcd}$ of $\left(p_{i}\right)^{r_{i}}$ and $\left(p_{i}\right)^{r_{i}-s_{i}}$ is $\left(p_{i}\right)^{r_{i}-s_{i}}$. Thus $\left(p_{i}\right)^{r_{i}-s_{i}}$ generates a cyclic subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}_{\left(p_{i}\right)^{r_{i}}}$ of order

$$
\left[\left(p_{i}\right)^{r_{i}}\right] /\left[\left(p_{i}\right)^{r_{i}-s_{i}}\right]=\left(p_{i}\right)^{s_{i}}
$$

Recalling that $\langle a\rangle$ denotes the cyclic subgroup generated by $a$, we see that

$$
\left\langle\left(p_{1}\right)^{r_{1}-s_{1}}\right\rangle \times\left\langle\left(p_{2}\right)^{r_{2}-s_{2}}\right\rangle \times \cdots \times\left\langle\left(p_{n}\right)^{r_{n}-s_{n}}\right\rangle
$$

is the required subgroup of order $m$.

11.17 Theorem If $m$ is a square free integer, that is, $m$ is not divisible by the square of any prime, then every abelian group of order $m$ is cyclic.

Proof Let $G$ be an abelian group of square free order $m$. Then by Theorem 11.12, $G$ is isomorphic to

$$
\mathbb{Z}_{\left(p_{1}\right)^{r_{1}}} \times \mathbb{Z}_{\left(p_{2}\right)^{r_{2}}} \times \cdots \times \mathbb{Z}_{\left(p_{n}\right)^{r_{n}}}
$$

where $m=\left(p_{1}\right)^{r_{1}}\left(p_{2}\right)^{r_{2}} \cdots\left(p_{n}\right)^{r_{n}}$. Since $m$ is square free, we must have all $r_{i}=1$ and all $p_{i}$ distinct primes. Corollary 11.6 then shows that $G$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_{p_{1} p_{2} \cdots p_{n}}$, so $G$ is cyclic.

Figure 7.9(b) shows such a Cayley digraph with $n=3$, and Figure 7.11(b) shows one with $n=4$. The arrows on the outer $n$-gon may have the same (clockwise or counterclockwise) direction as those on the inner $n$-gon, or they may have the opposite direction.

## SECTION $12 \dagger^{\dagger}$ PLANE ISOMETRIES

Consider the Euclidean plane $\mathbb{R}^{2}$. An isometry of $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ is a permutation $\phi: \mathbb{R}^{2} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{2}$ that preserves distance, so that the distance between points $P$ and $Q$ is the same as the distance between the points $\phi(P)$ and $\phi(Q)$ for all points $P$ and $Q$ in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$. If $\psi$ is also an isometry of $\mathbb{R}^{2}$, then the distance between $\psi(\phi(P))$ and $\psi(\phi(Q))$ must be the same as the distance between $\phi(P)$ and $\phi(Q)$, which in turn is the distance between $P$ and $Q$, showing that the composition of two isometries is again an isometry. Since the identity map is an isometry and the inverse of an isometry is an isometry, we see that the isometries of $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ form a subgroup of the group of all permutations of $\mathbb{R}^{2}$.

Given any subset $S$ of $\mathbb{R}^{2}$, the isometries of $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ that carry $S$ onto itself form a subgroup of the group of isometries. This subgroup is the group of symmetries of $S$ in

$\mathbb{R}^{2}$. In Section 8 we gave tables for the group of symmetries of an equilateral triangle and for the group of symmetries of a square in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$.

Everything we have defined in the two preceding paragraphs could equally well have been done for $n$-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, but we will concern ourselves chiefly with plane isometries here.

It can be proved that every isometry of the plane is one of just four types (see Artin [5]). We will list the types and show, for each type, a labeled figure that can be carried into itself by an isometry of that type. In each of Figs. 12.1, 12.3, and 12.4, consider the line with spikes shown to be extended infinitely to the left and to the right. We also give an example of each type in terms of coordinates.

translation $\tau$ : Slide every point the same distance in the same direction. See Fig. 12.1. (Example: $\tau(x, y)=(x, y)+(2,-3)=(x+2, y-3)$.)

rotation $\rho: \quad$ Rotate the plane about a point $P$ through an angle $\theta$. See Fig. 12.2. (Example: $\rho(x, y)=(-y, x)$ is a rotation through $90^{\circ}$ counterclockwise about the origin $(0,0)$.)

reflection $\mu$ : Map each point into its mirror image ( $\mu$ for mirror) across a line $L$, each point of which is left fixed by $\mu$. See Fig. 12.3. The line $L$ is the axis of reflection. $($ Example: $\mu(x, y)=(y, x)$ is a reflection across the line $y=x$.)

glide reflection $\gamma$ : The product of a translation and a reflection across a line mapped into itself by the translation. See Fig. 12.4. (Example: $\gamma(x, y)=(x+4,-y)$ is a glide reflection along the $x$-axis.)

Notice the little curved arrow that is carried into another curved arrow in each of Figs. 12.1 through 12.4. For the translation and rotation, the counterclockwise directions of the curved arrows remain the same, but for the reflection and glide reflection, the counterclockwise arrow is mapped into a clockwise arrow. We say that translations and rotations preserve orientation, while the reflection and glide reflection reverse orientation. We do not classify the identity isometry as any definite one of the four types listed; it could equally well be considered to be a translation by the zero vector or a rotation about any point through an angle of $0^{\circ}$. We always consider a glide reflection to be the product of a reflection and a translation that is different from the identity isometry.[^7]

The theorem that follows describes the possible structures of finite subgroups of the full isometry group.

12.5 Theorem Every finite group $G$ of isometries of the plane is isomorphic to either $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ or to a dihedral group $D_{n}$ for some positive integer $n$.

Proof Outline First we show that there is a point $P$ in the plane that is left fixed by every isometry in $G$. This can be done in the following way, using coordinates in the plane. Suppose $G=\left\{\phi_{1}, \phi_{2}, \cdots, \phi_{m}\right\}$ and let

$$
\left(x_{i}, y_{i}\right)=\phi_{i}(0,0) .
$$

Then the point

$$
P=(\bar{x}, \bar{y})=\left(\frac{x_{1}+x_{2}+\cdots+x_{m}}{m}, \frac{y_{1}+y_{2}+\cdots+y_{m}}{m}\right)
$$

is the centroid of the set $S=\left\{\left(x_{i}, y_{i}\right) \mid i=1,2, \cdots, m\right\}$. The isometries in $G$ permute the points in $S$ among themselves, since if $\phi_{i} \phi_{j}=\phi_{k}$ then $\phi_{i}\left(x_{j}, y_{j}\right)=\phi_{i}\left[\phi_{j}(0,0)\right]=$ $\phi_{k}(0,0)=\left(x_{k}, y_{k}\right)$. It can be shown that the centroid of a set of points is uniquely determined by its distances from the points, and since each isometry in $G$ just permutes the set $S$, it must leave the centroid $(\bar{x}, \bar{y})$ fixed. Thus $G$ consists of the identity, rotations about $P$, and reflections across a line through $P$.

The orientation-preserving isometries in $G$ form a subgroup $H$ of $G$ which is either all of $G$ or of order $m / 2$. This can be shown in the same way that we showed that the even permutations are a subgroup of $S_{n}$ containing just half the elements of $S_{n}$. (See Exercise 22.) Of course $H$ consists of the identity and the rotations in $G$. If we choose a rotation in $G$ that rotates the plane through as small an angle $\theta>0$ as possible, it can be shown to generate the subgroup $H$. (See Exercise 23.) This shows that if $H=G$, then $G$ is cyclic of order $m$ and thus isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_{m}$. Suppose $H \neq G$ so that $G$ contains
some reflections. Let $H=\left\{\iota, \rho_{1}, \cdots, \rho_{n-1}\right\}$ with $n=m / 2$. If $\mu$ is a reflection in $G$, then the coset $H \mu$ consists of all $n$ of the reflections in $G$.

Consider now a regular $n$-gon in the plane having $P$ as its center and with a vertex lying on the line through $P$ left fixed by $\mu$. The elements of $H$ rotate this $n$-gon through all positions, and the elements of $H \mu$ first reflect in an axis through a vertex, effectively turning the $n$-gon over, and then rotate through all positions. Thus the action of $G$ on this $n$-gon is the action of $D_{n}$, so $G$ is isomorphic to $D_{n}$.

The preceding theorem gives the complete story about finite plane isometry groups. We turn now to some infinite groups of plane isometries that arise naturally in decorating and art. Among these are the discrete frieze groups. A discrete frieze consists of a pattern of finite width and height that is repeated endlessly in both directions along its baseline to form a strip of infinite length but finite height; think of it as a decorative border strip that goes around a room next to the ceiling on wallpaper. We consider those isometries that carry each basic pattern onto itself or onto another instance of the pattern in the frieze. The set of all such isometries is called the "frieze group." All discrete frieze groups are infinite and have a subgroup isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}$ generated by the translation that slides the frieze lengthwise until the basic pattern is superimposed on the position of its next neighbor pattern in that direction. As a simple example of a discrete frieze, consider integral signs spaced equal distances apart and continuing infinitely to the left and right, indicated schematically like this.

$$
\cdots \iiint \iiint \iiint \iiint \iiint \iiint \iiint \iiint \iiint \int{ }_{\mathcal{B}}
$$

Let us consider the integral signs to be one unit apart. The symmetry group of this frieze is generated by a translation $\tau$ sliding the plane one unit to the right, and by a rotation $\rho$ of $180^{\circ}$ about a point in the center of some integral sign. There are no horizontal or vertical reflections, and no glide reflections. This frieze group is nonabelian; we can check that $\tau \rho=\rho \tau^{-1}$. The $n$-th dihedral group $D_{n}$ is generated by two elements that do not commute, a rotation $\rho_{1}$ through $360 / n^{\circ}$ of order $n$ and a reflection $\mu$ of order 2 satisfying $\rho_{1} \mu=\mu \rho_{1}^{-1}$. Thus it is natural to use the notation $D_{\infty}$ for this nonabelian frieze group generated by $\tau$ of infinite order and $\rho$ of order 2 .

As another example, consider the frieze given by an infinite string of D's.

## $\cdots$ D D D D D D D D D D D $\cdots$

Its group is generated by a translation $\tau$ one step to the right and by a vertical reflection $\mu$ across a horizontal line cutting through the middle of all the D's. We can check that these group generators commute this time, that is, $\tau \mu=\mu \tau$, so this frieze group is abelian and is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}_{2}$.

It can be shown that if we classify such discrete friezes only by whether or not their groups contain a

rotation horizontal axis reflection

vertical axis reflection nontrivial glide reflection

then there are a total of seven possibilities. A nontrivial glide reflection in a symmetry group is one that is not equal to a product of a translation in that group and a reflection in that group. The group for the string of D's above contains glide reflections across
the horizontal line through the centers of the D's, but the translation component of each glide reflection is also in the group so they are all considered trivial glide reflections in that group. The frieze group for

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_01_27_9289ad7bed1dd2e5e553g-122.jpg?height=130&width=1223&top_left_y=610&top_left_x=646)

contains a nontrivial glide reflection whose translation component is not an element of the group. The exercises exhibit the seven possible cases, and ask you to tell, for each case, which of the four types of isometries displayed above appear in the symmetry group. We do not obtain seven different group structures. Each of the groups obtained can be shown to be isomorphic to one of

$$
\mathbb{Z}, \quad D_{\infty}, \quad \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}_{2}, \quad \text { or } \quad D_{\infty} \times \mathbb{Z}_{2}
$$

Equally interesting is the study of symmetries when a pattern in the shape of a square, parallelogram, rhombus, or hexagon is repeated by translations along two nonparallel vector directions to fill the entire plane, like patterns that appear on wallpaper. These groups are called the wallpaper groups or the plane crystallographic groups. While a frieze could not be carried into itself by a rotation through a positive angle less than $180^{\circ}$, it is possible to have rotations of $60^{\circ}, 90^{\circ}, 120^{\circ}$, and $180^{\circ}$ for some of these plane-filling patterns. Figure 12.6 provides an illustration where the pattern consists of a square. We are interested in the group of plane isometries that carry this square onto itself or onto another square. Generators for this group are given by two translations (one sliding a square to the next neighbor to the right and one to the next above), by a rotation through $90^{\circ}$ about the center of a square, and by a reflection in a vertical (or horizontal) line along the edges of the square. The one reflection is all that is needed to "turn the plane over"; a diagonal reflection can also be used. After being turned over, the translations and rotations can be used again. The isometry group for this periodic pattern in the plane surely contains a subgroup isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}$ generated by the unit translations to the right and upward, and a subgroup isomorphic to $D_{4}$ generated by those isometries that carry one square (it can be any square) into itself.

If we consider the plane to be filled with parallelograms as in Fig. 12.7, we do not get all the types of isometries that we did for Fig. 12.6. The symmetry group this time is

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_01_27_9289ad7bed1dd2e5e553g-122.jpg?height=412&width=414&top_left_y=1930&top_left_x=1056)

generated by the translations indicated by the arrows and a rotation through $180^{\circ}$ about any vertex of a parallelogram.

It can be shown that there are 17 different types of wallpaper patterns when they are classified according to the types of rotations, reflections, and nontrivial glide reflections that they admit. We refer you to Gallian [8] for pictures of these 17 possibilities and a chart to help you identify them. The exercises illustrate a few of them. The situation in space is more complicated; it can be shown that there are 230 three-dimensional crystallographic groups. The final exercise we give involves rotations in space.

M. C. Escher (1898-1973) was an artist whose work included plane-filling patterns. The exercises include reproductions of four of his works of this type.

## EXERCISES 12

## Structure-Relating Maps

Let $G$ and $G^{\prime}$ be groups. We are interested in maps from $G$ to $G^{\prime}$ that relate the group structure of $G$ to the group structure of $G^{\prime}$. Such a map often gives us information about one of the groups from known structural properties of the other. An isomorphism $\phi: G \rightarrow G^{\prime}$, if one exists, is an example of such a structure-relating map. If we know all about the group $G$ and know that $\phi$ is an isomorphism, we immediately know all about the group structure of $G^{\prime}$, for it is structurally just a copy of $G$. We now consider more general structure-relating maps, weakening the conditions from those of an isomorphism by no longer requiring that the maps be one to one and onto. You see, those conditions are the purely set-theoretic portion of our definition of an isomorphism, and have nothing to do with the binary operations of $G$ and of $G^{\prime}$. The binary operations are what give us the algebra which is the focus of our study in this text. We keep just the homomorphism property of an isomorphism related to the binary operations for the definition we now make.

13.1 Definition A map $\phi$ of a group $G$ into a group $G^{\prime}$ is a homomorphism if the homomorphism property

$$
\phi(a b)=\phi(a) \phi(b)
$$

holds for all $a, b \in G$.[^8]

Let us now examine the idea behind the requirement (1) for a homomorphism $\phi: G \rightarrow G^{\prime}$. In Eq. (1), the product $a b$ on the left-hand side takes place in $G$, while the product $\phi(a) \phi(b)$ on the right-hand side takes place in $G^{\prime}$. Thus Eq. (1) gives a relation between these binary operations, and hence between the two group structures.

For any groups $G$ and $G^{\prime}$, there is always at least one homomorphism $\phi: G \rightarrow G^{\prime}$, namely the trivial homomorphism defined by $\phi(g)=e^{\prime}$ for all $g \in G$, where $e^{\prime}$ is the identity in $G^{\prime}$. Equation (1) then reduces to the true equation $e^{\prime}=e^{\prime} e^{\prime}$. No information about the structure of $G$ or $G^{\prime}$ can be gained from the other group using this trivial homomorphism. We give an example illustrating how a homomorphism $\phi$ mapping $G$ onto $G^{\prime}$ may give structural information about $G^{\prime}$.

13.2 Example Let $\phi: G \rightarrow G^{\prime}$ be a group homomorphism of $G$ onto $G^{\prime}$. We claim that if $G$ is abelian, then $G^{\prime}$ must be abelian. Let $a^{\prime}, b^{\prime} \in G^{\prime}$. We must show that $a^{\prime} b^{\prime}=b^{\prime} a^{\prime}$. Since $\phi$ is onto $G^{\prime}$, there exist $a, b \in G$ such that $\phi(a)=a^{\prime}$ and $\phi(b)=b^{\prime}$. Since $G$ is abelian, we have $a b=b a$. Using property (1), we have $a^{\prime} b^{\prime}=\phi(a) \phi(b)=\phi(a b)=\phi(b a)=$ $\phi(b) \phi(a)=b^{\prime} a^{\prime}$, so $G^{\prime}$ is indeed abelian.

Example 13.16 will give an illustration showing how information about $G^{\prime}$ may give information about $G$ via a homomorphism $\phi: G \rightarrow G^{\prime}$. We now give examples of homomorphisms for specific groups.

13.3 Example Let $S_{n}$ be the symmetric group on $n$ letters, and let $\phi: S_{n} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_{2}$ be defined by

$$
\phi(\sigma)= \begin{cases}0 & \text { if } \sigma \text { is an even permutation, } \\ 1 & \text { if } \sigma \text { is an odd permutation. }\end{cases}
$$

Show that $\phi$ is a homomorphism.

Solution We must show that $\phi(\sigma \mu)=\phi(\sigma)+\phi(\mu)$ for all choices of $\sigma, \mu \in S_{n}$. Note that the operation on the right-hand side of this equation is written additively since it takes place in the group $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$. Verifying this equation amounts to checking just four cases:

$\sigma$ odd and $\mu$ odd,

$\sigma$ odd and $\mu$ even,

$\sigma$ even and $\mu$ odd,

$\sigma$ even and $\mu$ even.

Checking the first case, if $\sigma$ and $\mu$ can both be written as a product of an odd number of transpositions, then $\sigma \mu$ can be written as the product of an even number of transpositions. Thus $\phi(\sigma \mu)=0$ and $\phi(\sigma)+\phi(\mu)=1+1=0$ in $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$. The other cases can be checked similarly.

13.4 Example (Evaluation Homomorphism) Let $F$ be the additive group of all functions mapping $\mathbb{R}$ into $\mathbb{R}$, let $\mathbb{R}$ be the additive group of real numbers, and let $c$ be any real number. Let $\phi_{c}: F \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be the evaluation homomorphism defined by $\phi_{c}(f)=f(c)$ for $f \in F$. Recall that, by definition, the sum of two functions $f$ and $g$ is the function $f+g$ whose value at $x$ is $f(x)+g(x)$. Thus we have

$$
\phi_{c}(f+g)=(f+g)(c)=f(c)+g(c)=\phi_{c}(f)+\phi_{c}(g),
$$

and Eq. (1) is satisfied, so we have a homomorphism.

13.5 Example Let $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ be the additive group of column vectors with $n$ real-number components. (This group is of course isomorphic to the direct product of $\mathbb{R}$ under addition with itself for $n$ factors.) Let $A$ be an $m \times n$ matrix of real numbers. Let $\phi: \mathbb{R}^{n} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{m}$ be defined by $\phi(\mathbf{v})=A \mathbf{v}$ for each column vector $\mathbf{v} \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$. Then $\phi$ is a homomorphism, since for $\mathbf{v}, \mathbf{w} \in$ $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, matrix algebra shows that $\phi(\mathbf{v}+\mathbf{w})=A(\mathbf{v}+\mathbf{w})=A \mathbf{v}+A \mathbf{w}=\phi(\mathbf{v})+\phi(\mathbf{w})$. In linear algebra, such a map computed by multiplying a column vector on the left by a matrix $A$ is known as a linear transformation.

13.6 Example Let $G L(n, \mathbb{R})$ be the multiplicative group of all invertible $n \times n$ matrices. Recall that a matrix $A$ is invertible if and only if its determinant, $\operatorname{det}(A)$, is nonzero. Recall also that for matrices $A, B \in G L(n, \mathbb{R})$ we have

$$
\operatorname{det}(A B)=\operatorname{det}(A) \operatorname{det}(B)
$$

This means that det is a homomorphism mapping $G L(n, \mathbb{R})$ into the multiplicative group $\mathbb{R}^{*}$ of nonzero real numbers.

Homomorphisms of a group $G$ into itself are often useful for studying the structure of $G$. Our next example gives a nontrivial homomorphism of a group into itself.

13.7 Example $\quad$ Let $r \in \mathbb{Z}$ and let $\phi_{r}: \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$ be defined by $\phi_{r}(n)=r n$ for all $n \in \mathbb{Z}$. For all $m, n \in \mathbb{Z}$, we have $\phi_{r}(m+n)=r(m+n)=r m+r n=\phi_{r}(m)+\phi_{r}(n)$ so $\phi_{r}$ is a homomorphism. Note that $\phi_{0}$ is the trivial homomorphism, $\phi_{1}$ is the identity map, and $\phi_{-1}$ maps $\mathbb{Z}$ onto $\mathbb{Z}$. For all other $r$ in $\mathbb{Z}$, the map $\phi_{r}$ is not onto $\mathbb{Z}$.

13.8 Example Let $G=G_{1} \times G_{2} \times \cdots \times G_{i} \times \cdots \times G_{n}$ be a direct product of groups. The projection map $\pi_{i}: G \rightarrow G_{i}$ where $\pi_{i}\left(g_{1}, g_{2}, \cdots, g_{i}, \cdots, g_{n}\right)=g_{i}$ is a homomorphism for each $i=1,2, \cdots, n$. This follows immediately from the fact that the binary operation of $G$ coincides in the $i$ th component with the binary operation in $G_{i}$.

13.9 Example Let $F$ be the additive group of continuous functions with domain $[0,1]$ and let $\mathbb{R}$ be the additive group of real numbers. The map $\sigma: F \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ defined by $\sigma(f)=\int_{0}^{1} f(x) d x$ for $f \in F$ is a homomorphism, for

$$
\begin{aligned}
\sigma(f+g) & =\int_{0}^{1}(f+g)(x) d x=\int_{0}^{1}[f(x)+g(x)] d x \\
& =\int_{0}^{1} f(x) d x+\int_{0}^{1} g(x) d x=\sigma(f)+\sigma(g)
\end{aligned}
$$

for all $f, g \in F$.

13.10 Example (Reduction Modulo $\boldsymbol{n}$ ) Let $\gamma$ be the natural map of $\mathbb{Z}$ into $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ given by $\gamma(m)=r$, where $r$ is the remainder given by the division algorithm when $m$ is divided by $n$. Show that $\gamma$ is a homomorphism.

Solution We need to show that

$$
\gamma(s+t)=\gamma(s)+\gamma(t)
$$

for $s, t \in \mathbb{Z}$. Using the division algorithm, we let

$$
s=q_{1} n+r_{1}
$$

and

$$
t=q_{2} n+r_{2}
$$

where $0 \leq r_{i}<n$ for $i=1$, 2. If

$$
r_{1}+r_{2}=q_{3} n+r_{3}
$$

for $0 \leq r_{3}<n$, then adding Eqs. (2) and (3) we see that

$$
s+t=\left(q_{1}+q_{2}+q_{3}\right) n+r_{3},
$$

so that $\gamma(s+t)=r_{3}$.

From Eqs. (2) and (3) we see that $\gamma(s)=r_{1}$ and $\gamma(t)=r_{2}$. Equation (4) shows that the sum $r_{1}+r_{2}$ in $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ is equal to $r_{3}$ also.

Consequently $\gamma(s+t)=\gamma(s)+\gamma(t)$, so we do indeed have a homomorphism.

Each of the homomorphisms in the preceding three examples is a many-to-one map. That is, different points of the domain of the map may be carried into the same point. Consider, for illustration, the homomorphism $\pi_{1}: \mathbb{Z}_{2} \times \mathbb{Z}_{4} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_{2}$ in Example 13.8 We have

$$
\pi_{1}(0,0)=\pi_{1}(0,1)=\pi_{1}(0,2)=\pi_{1}(0,3)=0,
$$

so four elements in $\mathbb{Z}_{2} \times \mathbb{Z}_{4}$ are mapped into 0 in $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ by $\pi_{1}$.

Composition of group homomorphisms is again a group homomorphism. That is, if $\phi: G \rightarrow G^{\prime}$ and $\gamma: G^{\prime} \rightarrow G^{\prime \prime}$ are both group homomorphisms then their composition $(\gamma \circ \phi): G \rightarrow G^{\prime \prime}$, where $(\gamma \circ \phi)(g)=\gamma(\phi(g))$ for $g \in G$, is also a homomorphism. (See Exercise 49.)

## Properties of Homomorphisms

We turn to some structural features of $G$ and $G^{\prime}$ that are preserved by a homomorphism $\phi: G \rightarrow G^{\prime}$. First we review set-theoretic definitions. Note the use of square brackets when we apply a function to a subset of its domain.

13.11 Definition Let $\phi$ be a mapping of a set $X$ into a set $Y$, and let $A \subseteq X$ and $B \subseteq Y$. The image $\phi[A]$ of $A$ in $Y$ under $\phi$ is $\{\phi(a) \mid a \in A\}$. The set $\phi[X]$ is the range of $\phi$. The inverse image $\phi^{-1}[B]$ of $B$ in $X$ is $\{x \in X \mid \phi(x) \in B\}$.

The first three properties of a homomorphism stated in the theorem that follows have already been encountered for the special case of an isomorphism; namely, in Theorem 3.14, Exercise 28 of Section 4, and Exercise 41 of Section 5. There they were really obvious because the structures of $G$ and $G^{\prime}$ were identical. We will now see that they hold for structure-relating maps of groups, even if the maps are not one to one and onto. We do not consider them obvious in this new context.

13.12 Theorem Let $\phi$ be a homomorphism of a group $G$ into a group $G^{\prime}$.

1. If $e$ is the identity element in $G$, then $\phi(e)$ is the identity element $e^{\prime}$ in $G^{\prime}$.
2. If $a \in G$, then $\phi\left(a^{-1}\right)=\phi(a)^{-1}$.
3. If $H$ is a subgroup of $G$, then $\phi[H]$ is a subgroup of $G^{\prime}$.
4. If $K^{\prime}$ is a subgroup of $G^{\prime} \cap \phi[G]$, then $\phi^{-1}\left[K^{\prime}\right]$ is a subgroup of $G$.

Loosely speaking, $\phi$ preserves the identity element, inverses, and subgroups.

Proof Let $\phi$ be a homomorphism of $G$ into $G^{\prime}$. Then

$$
\phi(a)=\phi(a e)=\phi(a) \phi(e) .
$$

Multiplying on the left by $\phi(a)^{-1}$, we see that $e^{\prime}=\phi(e)$. Thus $\phi(e)$ must be the identity element $e^{\prime}$ in $G^{\prime}$. The equation

$$
e^{\prime}=\phi(e)=\phi\left(a a^{-1}\right)=\phi(a) \phi\left(a^{-1}\right)
$$

shows that $\phi\left(a^{-1}\right)=\phi(a)^{-1}$.

Turning to Statement (3), let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$, and let $\phi(a)$ and $\phi(b)$ be any two elements in $\phi[H]$. Then $\phi(a) \phi(b)=\phi(a b)$, so we see that $\phi(a) \phi(b) \in \phi[H]$; thus, $\phi[H]$ is closed under the operation of $G^{\prime}$. The fact that $e^{\prime}=\phi(e)$ and $\phi\left(a^{-1}\right)=\phi(a)^{-1}$ completes the proof that $\phi[H]$ is a subgroup of $G^{\prime}$.

Going the other way for Statement (4), let $K^{\prime}$ be a subgroup of $G^{\prime}$. Suppose $a$ and $b$ are in $\phi^{-1}\left[K^{\prime}\right]$. Then $\phi(a) \phi(b) \in K^{\prime}$ since $K^{\prime}$ is a subgroup. The equation $\phi(a b)=\phi(a) \phi(b)$ shows that $a b \in \phi^{-1}\left[K^{\prime}\right]$. Thus $\phi^{-1}\left[K^{\prime}\right]$ is closed under the binary operation in $G$. Also, $K^{\prime}$ must contain the identity element $e^{\prime}=\phi(e)$, so $e \in \phi^{-1}\left[K^{\prime}\right]$. If $a \in \phi^{-1}\left[K^{\prime}\right]$, then $\phi(a) \in K^{\prime}$, so $\phi(a)^{-1} \in K^{\prime}$. But $\phi(a)^{-1}=\phi\left(a^{-1}\right)$, so we must have $a^{-1} \in \phi^{-1}\left[K^{\prime}\right]$. Hence $\phi^{-1}\left[K^{\prime}\right]$ is a subgroup of $G$.

Let $\phi: G \rightarrow G^{\prime}$ be a homomorphism and let $e^{\prime}$ be the identity element of $G^{\prime}$. Now $\left\{e^{\prime}\right\}$ is a subgroup of $G^{\prime}$, so $\phi^{-1}\left[\left\{e^{\prime}\right\}\right]$ is a subgroup $H$ of $G$ by Statement (4) in Theorem 13.12. This subgroup is critical to the study of homomorphisms.

13.13 Definition Let $\phi: G \rightarrow G^{\prime}$ be a homomorphism of groups. The subgroup $\phi^{-1}\left[\left\{e^{\prime}\right\}\right]=$ $\left\{x \in G \mid \phi(x)=e^{\prime}\right\}$ is the kernel of $\phi$, denoted by $\operatorname{Ker}(\phi)$.

Example 13.5 discussed the homomorphism $\phi: \mathbb{R}^{n} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{m}$ given by $\phi(\mathbf{v})=\boldsymbol{A} \mathbf{v}$ where $A$ is an $m \times n$ matrix. In this context, $\operatorname{Ker}(\phi)$ is called the null space of $A$. It consists of all $\mathbf{v} \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ such that $A \mathbf{v}=\mathbf{0}$, the zero vector.

Let $H=\operatorname{Ker}(\phi)$ for a homomorphism $\phi: G \rightarrow G^{\prime}$. We think of $\phi$ as "collapsing" $H$ down onto $e^{\prime}$. Theorem 13.15 that follows shows that for $g \in G$, the cosets $g H$ and $H g$ are the same, and are collapsed onto the single element $\phi(g)$ by $\phi$. That is $\phi^{-1}[\{\phi(g)\}]=g H=H g$. (Be sure that you understand the reason for the uses of ()$,[]$, and \{\} in $\phi^{-1}[\{\phi(g)\}]$.) We have attempted to symbolize this collapsing in Fig. 13.14, where the shaded rectangle represents $G$, the solid vertical line segments represent the cosets of $H=\operatorname{Ker}(\phi)$, and the horizontal line at the bottom represents $G^{\prime}$. We view $\phi$ as projecting the elements of $G$, which are in the shaded rectangle, straight down onto elements of $G^{\prime}$, which are on the horizontal line segment at the bottom. Notice the downward arrow labeled $\phi$ at the left, starting at $G$ and ending at $G^{\prime}$. Elements of $H=\operatorname{Ker}(\phi)$ thus lie on the solid vertical line segment in the shaded box lying over $e^{\prime}$, as labeled at the top of the figure.

13.14 Figure Cosets of $H$ collapsed by $\phi$.

13.15 Theorem Let $\phi: G \rightarrow G^{\prime}$ be a group homomorphism, and let $H=\operatorname{Ker}(\phi)$. Let $a \in G$. Then the set

$$
\phi^{-1}[\{\phi(a)\}]=\{x \in G \mid \phi(x)=\phi(a)\}
$$

is the left coset $a H$ of $H$, and is also the right coset $H a$ of $H$. Consequently, the two partitions of $G$ into left cosets and into right cosets of $H$ are the same.

Proof We want to show that

$$
\{x \in G \mid \phi(x)=\phi(a)\}=a H .
$$

There is a standard way to show that two sets are equal; show that each is a subset of the other.

Suppose that $\phi(x)=\phi(a)$. Then

$$
\phi(a)^{-1} \phi(x)=e^{\prime}
$$

where $e^{\prime}$ is the identity of $G^{\prime}$. By Theorem 13.12, we know that $\phi(a)^{-1}=\phi\left(a^{-1}\right)$, so we have

$$
\phi\left(a^{-1}\right) \phi(x)=e^{\prime} .
$$

Since $\phi$ is a homomorphism, we have

$$
\phi\left(a^{-1}\right) \phi(x)=\phi\left(a^{-1} x\right), \quad \text { so } \quad \phi\left(a^{-1} x\right)=e^{\prime} \text {. }
$$

But this shows that $a^{-1} x$ is in $H=\operatorname{Ker}(\phi)$, so $a^{-1} x=h$ for some $h \in H$, and $x=$ $a h \in a H$. This shows that

$$
\{x \in G \mid \phi(x)=\phi(a)\} \subseteq a H
$$

To show containment in the other direction, let $y \in a H$, so that $y=a h$ for some $h \in H$. Then

$$
\phi(y)=\phi(a h)=\phi(a) \phi(h)=\phi(a) e^{\prime}=\phi(a)
$$

so that $y \in\{x \in G \mid \phi(x)=\phi(a)\}$.

We leave the similar demonstration that $\{x \in G \mid \phi(x)=\phi(a)\}=H a$ to Exercise 52 .

13.16 Example Equation 5 of Section 1 shows that $\left|z_{1} z_{2}\right|=\left|z_{1}\right|\left|z_{2}\right|$ for complex numbers $z_{1}$ and $z_{2}$. This means that the absolute value function || is a homomorphism of the group $\mathbb{C}^{*}$ of nonzero complex numbers under multiplication onto the group $\mathbb{R}^{+}$of positive real numbers under multiplication. Since $\{1\}$ is a subgroup of $\mathbb{R}^{+}$, Theorem 13.12 shows again that the complex numbers of magnitude 1 form a subgroup $U$ of $\mathbb{C}^{*}$. Recall that the complex numbers can be viewed as filling the coordinate plane, and that the magnitude of a complex number is its distance from the origin. Consequently, the cosets of $U$ are circles with center at the origin. Each circle is collapsed by this homomorphism onto its point of intersection with the positive real axis.

We give an illustration of Theorem 13.15 from calculus.

13.17 Example Let $D$ be the additive group of all differentiable functions mapping $\mathbb{R}$ into $\mathbb{R}$, and let $F$ be the additive group of all functions mapping $\mathbb{R}$ into $\mathbb{R}$. Then differentiation gives us a $\operatorname{map} \phi: D \rightarrow F$, where $\phi(f)=f^{\prime}$ for $f \in F$. We easily see that $\phi$ is a homomorphism, for $\phi(f+g)=(f+g)^{\prime}=f^{\prime}+g^{\prime}=\phi(f)+\phi(g)$; the derivative of a sum is the sum of the derivatives.

Now $\operatorname{Ker}(\phi)$ consists of all functions $f$ such that $f^{\prime}=0$, the zero constant function. Thus $\operatorname{Ker}(\phi)$ consists of all constant functions, which form a subgroup $C$ of $F$. Let us find all functions in $D$ mapped into $x^{2}$ by $\phi$, that is, all functions whose derivative is $x^{2}$. Now we know that $x^{3} / 3$ is one such function. By Theorem 13.15, all such functions form the coset $x^{3} / 3+C$. Doesn't this look familiar?

We will often use the following corollary of Theorem 13.15.

13.18 Corollary A group homomorphism $\phi: G \rightarrow G^{\prime}$ is a one-to-one map if and only if $\operatorname{Ker}(\phi)=\{e\}$.

Proof If $\operatorname{Ker}(\phi)=\{e\}$, then for every $a \in G$, the elements mapped into $\phi(a)$ are precisely the elements of the left $\operatorname{coset} a\{e\}=\{a\}$, which shows that $\phi$ is one to one.

Conversely, suppose $\phi$ is one to one. Now by Theorem 13.12, we know that $\phi(e)=e^{\prime}$, the identity element of $G^{\prime}$. Since $\phi$ is one to one, we see that $e$ is the only element mapped into $e^{\prime}$ by $\phi$, so $\operatorname{Ker}(\phi)=\{e\}$.

In view of Corollary 13.18, we modify the outline given prior to Example 3.8 for showing that a map $\phi$ is an isomorphism of binary structures when the structures are groups $G$ and $G^{\prime}$.

## To Show $\phi: G \rightarrow G^{\prime}$ Is an Isomorphism

Step 1 Show $\phi$ is a homomorphism.

Step 2 Show $\operatorname{Ker}(\phi)=\{e\}$.

Step 3 Show $\phi$ maps $G$ onto $G^{\prime}$.

Theorem 13.15 shows that the kernel of a group homomorphism $\phi: G \rightarrow G^{\prime}$ is a subgroup $H$ of $G$ whose left and right cosets coincide, so that $g H=H g$ for all $g \in G$. We will see in Section 14 that when left and right cosets coincide, we can form a coset group, as discussed intuitively in Section 10. Furthermore, we will see that $H$ then appears as the kernel of a homomorphism of $G$ onto this coset group in a very natural way. Such subgroups $H$ whose left and right cosets coincide are very useful in studying a group, and are given a special name. We will work with them a lot in Section 14.

## Historical Note

Jormal subgroups were introduced by Evariste Galois in 1831 as a tool for deciding whether a given polynomial equation was solvable by radicals. Galois noted that a subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ of permutations induced two decompositions of $G$ into what we call left cosets and right cosets. If the two decompositions coincide, that is, if the left cosets are the same as the right cosets, Galois called the decomposition proper. Thus a subgroup giving a proper decomposition is what we call a normal subgroup. Galois stated that if the group of permutations of the roots of an equation has a proper decomposition, then one can solve the given equation if one can first solve an equation corresponding to the subgroup $H$ and then an equation corresponding to the cosets.

Camille Jordan, in his commentaries on Galois's work in 1865 and 1869, elaborated on these ideas considerably. He also defined normal subgroups, although without using the term, essentially as on this page and likewise gave the first definition of a simple group (page 149).

13.19 Definition A subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is normal if its left and right cosets coincide, that is, if $g H=H g$ for all $g \in G$.

Note that all subgroups of abelian groups are normal.

13.20 Corollary If $\phi: G \rightarrow G^{\prime}$ is a group homomorphism, then $\operatorname{Ker}(\phi)$ is a normal subgroup of $G$.

Proof This follows immediately from the last sentence in the statement of Theorem 13.15 and Definition 13.19.

For any group homomorphism $\phi: G \rightarrow G^{\prime}$, two things are of primary importance: the kernel of $\phi$, and the image $\phi[G]$ of $G$ in $G^{\prime}$. We have indicated the importance of

## Section 13 Exercises

$\operatorname{Ker}(\phi)$. Section 14 will indicate the importance of the image $\phi[G]$. Exercise 44 asks us to show that if $|G|$ is finite, then $|\phi[G]|$ is finite and is a divisor of $|G|$.

## Computations

In Exercises 1 through 15, determine whether the given map $\phi$ is a homomorphism. [Hint: The straightforward way to proceed is to check whether $\phi(a b)=\phi(a) \phi(b)$ for all $a$ and $b$ in the domain of $\phi$. However, if we should happen to notice that $\phi^{-1}\left[\left\{e^{\prime}\right\}\right]$ is not a subgroup whose left and right cosets coincide, or that $\phi$ does not satisfy the properties given in Exercise 44 or 45 for finite groups, then we can say at once that $\phi$ is not a homomorphism.]

## SECTION 14 Factor Groups

Let $H$ be a subgroup of a finite group $G$. Suppose we write a table for the group operation of $G$, listing element heads at the top and at the left as they occur in the left cosets of $H$. We illustrated this in Section 10. The body of the table may break up into blocks corresponding to the cosets (Table 10.5), giving a group operation on the cosets, or they may not break up that way (Table 10.9). We start this section by showing that if $H$ is the kernel of a group homomorphism $\phi: G \rightarrow G^{\prime}$, then the cosets of $H$ (remember that left and right cosets then coincide) are indeed elements of a group whose binary operation is derived from the group operation of $G$.

## Factor Groups from Homomorphisms

Let $G$ be a group and let $S$ be a set having the same cardinality as $G$. Then there is a oneto-one correspondence $\leftrightarrow$ between $S$ and $G$. We can use $\leftrightarrow$ to define a binary operation on $S$, making $S$ into a group isomorphic to $G$. Naively, we simply use the correspondence to rename each element of $G$ by the name of its corresponding (under $\leftrightarrow$ ) element in $S$. We can describe explicitly the computation of $x y$ for $x, y \in S$ as follows:

$$
\text { if } x \leftrightarrow g_{1} \quad \text { and } \quad y \leftrightarrow g_{2} \quad \text { and } \quad z \leftrightarrow g_{1} g_{2}, \quad \text { then } \quad x y=z \text {. }
$$

The direction $\rightarrow$ of the one-to-one correspondence $s \leftrightarrow g$ between $s \in S$ and $g \in G$ gives us a one-to-one function $\mu$ mapping $S$ onto $G$. (Of course, the direction $\leftarrow$ of $\leftrightarrow$ gives us the inverse function $\mu^{-1}$ ). Expressed in terms of $\mu$, the computation (1) of $x y$ for $x, y \in S$ becomes

$$
\text { if } \mu(x)=g_{1} \quad \text { and } \quad \mu(y)=g_{2} \quad \text { and } \quad \mu(z)=g_{1} g_{2}, \quad \text { then } \quad x y=z
$$

The map $\mu: S \rightarrow G$ now becomes an isomorphism mapping the group $S$ onto the group $G$. Notice that from (2), we obtain $\mu(x y)=\mu(z)=g_{1} g_{2}=\mu(x) \mu(y)$, the required homomorphism property.

Let $G$ and $G^{\prime}$ be groups, let $\phi: G \rightarrow G^{\prime}$ be a homomorphism, and let $H=\operatorname{Ker}(\phi)$. Theorem 13.15 shows that for $a \in G$, we have $\phi^{-1}[\{\phi(a)\}]=a H=H a$. We have a one-to-one correspondence $a H \leftrightarrow \phi(a)$ between cosets of $H$ in $G$ and elements of the subgroup $\phi[G]$ of $G^{\prime}$. Remember that if $x \in a H$, so that $x=a h$ for some $h \in H$, then $\phi(x)=\phi(a h)=\phi(a) \phi(h)=\phi(a) e^{\prime}=\phi(a)$, so the computation of the element of $\phi[G]$ corresponding to the coset $a H=x H$ is the same whether we compute it as $\phi(a)$ or as $\phi(x)$. Let us denote the set of all cosets of $H$ by $G / H$. (We read $G / H$ as " $G$ over $H$ " or as " $G$ modulo $H$ " or as " $G \bmod H$," but never as " $G$ divided by $H$.")

In the preceding paragraph, we started with a homomorphism $\phi: G \rightarrow G^{\prime}$ having kernel $H$, and we finished with the set $G / H$ of cosets in one-to-one correspondence with the elements of the group $\phi[G]$. In our work above that, we had a set $S$ with elements in one-to-one correspondence with those of a group $G$, and we made $S$ into a group isomorphic to $G$ with an isomorphism $\mu$. Replacing $S$ by $G / H$ and replacing $G$ by $\phi[G]$ in that construction, we can consider $G / H$ to be a group isomorphic to $\phi[G]$ with that isomorphism $\mu$. In terms of $G / H$ and $\phi[G]$, the computation (2) of the product $(x H)(y H)$ for $x H, y H \in G / H$ becomes

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { if } \mu(x H)=\phi(x) \text { and } \mu(y H)=\phi(y) \text { and } \mu(z H)=\phi(x) \phi(y) \text {, } \\
& \text { then }(x H)(y H)=z H .
\end{aligned}
$$

But because $\phi$ is a homomorphism, we can easily find $z \in G$ such that $\mu(z H)=$ $\phi(x) \phi(y)$; namely, we take $z=x y$ in $G$, and find that

$$
\mu(z H)=\mu(x y H)=\phi(x y)=\phi(x) \phi(y) .
$$

This shows that the product $(x H)(y H)$ of two cosets is the coset $(x y) H$ that contains the product $x y$ of $x$ and $y$ in $G$. While this computation of $(x H)(y H)$ may seem to depend on our choices $x$ from $x H$ and $y$ from $y H$, our work above shows it does not. We demonstrate it again here because it is such an important point. If $h_{1}, h_{2} \in H$ so that $x h_{1}$ is an element of $x H$ and $y h_{2}$ is an element of $y H$, then there exists $h_{3} \in H$ such
that $h_{1} y=y h_{3}$ because $H y=y H$ by Theorem 13.15. Thus we have

$$
\left(x h_{1}\right)\left(y h_{2}\right)=x\left(h_{1} y\right) h_{2}=x\left(y h_{3}\right) h_{2}=(x y)\left(h_{3} h_{2}\right) \in(x y) H,
$$

so we obtain the same coset. Computation of the product of two cosets is accomplished by choosing an element from each coset and taking, as product of the cosets, the coset that contains the product in $G$ of the choices. Any time we define something (like a product) in terms of choices, it is important to show that it is well defined, which means that it is independent of the choices made. This is precisely what we have just done. We summarize this work in a theorem.

14.1 Theorem Let $\phi: G \rightarrow G^{\prime}$ be a group homomorphism with kernel $H$. Then the cosets of $H$ form a factor group, $G / H$, where $(a H)(b H)=(a b) H$. Also, the map $\mu: G / H \rightarrow \phi[G]$ defined by $\mu(a H)=\phi(a)$ is an isomorphism. Both coset multiplication and $\mu$ are well defined, independent of the choices $a$ and $b$ from the cosets.

14.2 Example Example 13.10 considered the map $\gamma: \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_{n}$, where $\gamma(m)$ is the remainder when $m$ is divided by $n$ in accordance with the division algorithm. We know that $\gamma$ is a homomorphism. Of course, $\operatorname{Ker}(\gamma)=n \mathbb{Z}$. By Theorem 14.1, we see that the factor group $\mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z}$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$. The cosets of $n \mathbb{Z}$ are the residue classes modulo $n$. For example, taking $n=5$, we see the cosets of $5 \mathbb{Z}$ are

$$
\begin{aligned}
5 \mathbb{Z} & =\{\cdots,-10,-5,0,5,10, \cdots\}, \\
1+5 \mathbb{Z} & =\{\cdots,-9,-4,1,6,11, \cdots\} \\
2+5 \mathbb{Z} & =\{\cdots,-8,-3,2,7,12, \cdots\} \\
3+5 \mathbb{Z} & =\{\cdots,-7,-2,3,8,13, \cdots\} \\
4+5 \mathbb{Z} & =\{\cdots,-6,-1,4,9,14, \cdots\}
\end{aligned}
$$

Note that the isomorphism $\mu: \mathbb{Z} / 5 \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_{5}$ of Theorem 14.1 assigns to each coset of $5 \mathbb{Z}$ its smallest nonnegative element. That is, $\mu(5 \mathbb{Z})=0, \mu(1+5 \mathbb{Z})=1$, etc.

It is very important that we learn how to compute in a factor group. We can multiply (add) two cosets by choosing any two representative elements, multiplying (adding) them and finding the coset in which the resulting product (sum) lies.

14.3 Example Consider the factor group $\mathbb{Z} / 5 \mathbb{Z}$ with the cosets shown above. We can add $(2+5 \mathbb{Z})+$ $(4+5 \mathbb{Z})$ by choosing 2 and 4 , finding $2+4=6$, and noticing that 6 is in the coset $1+5 \mathbb{Z}$. We could equally well add these two cosets by choosing 27 in $2+5 \mathbb{Z}$ and -16 in $4+5 \mathbb{Z}$; the sum $27+(-16)=11$ is also in the coset $1+5 \mathbb{Z}$.

The factor groups $\mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z}$ in the preceding example are classics. Recall that we refer to the cosets of $n \mathbb{Z}$ as residue classes modulo $n$. Two integers in the same coset are congruent modulo $n$. This terminology is carried over to other factor groups. A factor group $G / H$ is often called the factor group of $G$ modulo $H$. Elements in the same coset of $H$ are often said to be congruent modulo $H$. By abuse of notation, we may sometimes write $\mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z}=\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ and think of $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ as the additive group of residue classes of $\mathbb{Z}$ modulo $\langle n\rangle$, or abusing notation further, modulo $n$.

## Factor Groups from Normal Subgroups

So far, we have obtained factor groups only from homomorphisms. Let $G$ be a group and let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$. Now $H$ has both left cosets and right cosets, and in general, a left coset $a H$ need not be the same set as the right coset $H a$. Suppose we try to define a binary operation on left cosets by defining

$$
(a H)(b H)=(a b) H
$$

as in the statement of Theorem 14.1. Equation 4 attempts to define left coset multiplication by choosing representatives $a$ and $b$ from the cosets. Equation 4 is meaningless unless it gives a well-defined operation, independent of the representative elements $a$ and $b$ chosen from the cosets. The theorem that follows shows that Eq. 4 gives a well-defined binary operation if and only if $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$.

14.4 Theorem Let $H$ be a subgroup of a group $G$. Then left coset multiplication is well defined by the equation

$$
(a H)(b H)=(a b) H
$$

if and only if $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$.

Proof Suppose first that $(a H)(b H)=(a b) H$ does give a well-defined binary operation on left cosets. Let $a \in G$. We want to show that $a H$ and $H a$ are the same set. We use the standard technique of showing that each is a subset of the other.

Let $x \in a H$. Choosing representatives $x \in a H$ and $a^{-1} \in a^{-1} H$, we have $(x H)\left(a^{-1} H\right)=\left(x a^{-1}\right) H$. On the other hand, choosing representatives $a \in a H$ and $a^{-1} \in a^{-1} H$, we see that $(a H)\left(a^{-1} H\right)=e H=H$. Using our assumption that left coset multiplication by representatives is well defined, we must have $x a^{-1}=h \in H$. Then $x=h a$, so $x \in H a$ and $a H \subseteq H a$. We leave the symmetric proof that $H a \subseteq a H$ to Exercise 25.

We turn now to the converse: If $H$ is a normal subgroup, then left coset multiplication by representatives is well-defined. Due to our hypothesis, we can simply say cosets, omitting left and right. Suppose we wish to compute $(a H)(b H)$. Choosing $a \in a H$ and $b \in b H$, we obtain the coset $(a b) H$. Choosing different representatives $a h_{1} \in a H$ and $b h_{2} \in b H$, we obtain the coset $a h_{1} b h_{2} H$. We must show that these are the same cosets. Now $h_{1} b \in H b=b H$, so $h_{1} b=b h_{3}$ for some $h_{3} \in H$. Thus

$$
\left(a h_{1}\right)\left(b h_{2}\right)=a\left(h_{1} b\right) h_{2}=a\left(b h_{3}\right) h_{2}=(a b)\left(h_{3} h_{2}\right)
$$

and $(a b)\left(h_{3} h_{2}\right) \in(a b) H$. Therefore, $a h_{1} b h_{2}$ is in $(a b) H$.

Theorem 14.4 shows that if left and right cosets of $H$ coincide, then Eq. 4 gives a well-defined binary operation on cosets. We wonder whether the cosets do form a group with such coset multiplication. This is indeed true.

14.5 Corollary Let $H$ be a normal subgroup of $G$. Then the cosets of $H$ form a group $G / H$ under the binary operation $(a H)(b H)=(a b) H$.

Proof Computing, $(a H)[(b H)(c H)]=(a H)[(b c) H]=[a(b c)] H$, and similarly, we have $[(a H)(b H)](c H)=[(a b) c] H$, so associativity in $G / H$ follows from associativity in $G$. Because $(a H)(e H)=(a e) H=a H=(e a) H=(e H)(a H)$, we see that $e H=H$ is the identity element in $G / H$. Finally, $\left(a^{-1} H\right)(a H)=\left(a^{-1} a\right) H=e H=\left(a a^{-1}\right) H=$ $(a H)\left(a^{-1} H\right)$ shows that $a^{-1} H=(a H)^{-1}$.

14.6 Definition The group $G / H$ in the preceding corollary is the factor group (or quotient group) of $G$ by $H$.

14.7 Example $\quad$ Since $\mathbb{Z}$ is an abelian group, $n \mathbb{Z}$ is a normal subgroup. Corollary 14.5 allows us to construct the factor group $\mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z}$ with no reference to a homomorphism. As we observed in Example 14.2, $\mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z}$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$.

14.8 Example Consider the abelian group $\mathbb{R}$ under addition, and let $c \in \mathbb{R}^{+}$. The cyclic subgroup $\langle c\rangle$ of $\mathbb{R}$ contains as elements

$$
\cdots-3 c,-2 c,-c, 0, c, 2 c, 3 c, \cdots
$$

Every coset of $\langle c\rangle$ contains just one element $x$ such that $0 \leq x<c$. If we choose these elements as representatives of the cosets when computing in $\mathbb{R} /\langle c\rangle$, we find that we are computing their sum modulo $c$ as discussed for the computation in $\mathbb{R}_{c}$ in Section 1. For example, if $c=5.37$, then the sum of the cosets $4.65+\langle 5.37\rangle$ and $3.42+\langle 5.37\rangle$ is the coset $8.07+\langle 5.37\rangle$, which contains $8.07-5.37=2.7$, which is $4.65+5.373 .42$. Working with these coset elements $x$ where $0 \leq x<c$, we thus see that the group $\mathbb{R}_{c}$ of Example 4.2 is isomorphic to $\mathbb{R} /\langle c\rangle$ under an isomorphism $\psi$ where $\psi(x)=x+\langle c\rangle$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}_{c}$. Of course, $\mathbb{R} /\langle c\rangle$ is then also isomorphic to the circle group $U$ of complex numbers of magnitude 1 under multiplication.

We have seen that the group $\mathbb{Z} /\langle n\rangle$ is isomorphic to the group $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$, and as a set, $\mathbb{Z}_{n}=\{0,1,3,4, \cdots, n-1\}$, the set of nonnegative integers less than $n$. Example 14.8 shows that the group $\mathbb{R} /\langle c\rangle$ is isomorphic to the group $\mathbb{R}_{c}$. In Section 1 , we choose the notation $\mathbb{R}_{c}$ rather than the conventional $[0, c)$ for the half-open interval of nonnegative real numbers less than $c$. We did that to bring out now the comparison of these factor groups of $\mathbb{Z}$ with these factor groups of $\mathbb{R}$.

## The Fundamental Homomorphism Theorem

We have seen that every homomorphism $\phi: G \rightarrow G^{\prime}$ gives rise to a natural factor group (Theorem 14.1), namely, $G / \operatorname{Ker}(\phi)$. We now show that each factor group $G / H$ gives rise to a natural homomorphism having $H$ as kernel.

14.9 Theorem Let $H$ be a normal subgroup of $G$. Then $\gamma: G \rightarrow G / H$ given by $\gamma(x)=x H$ is a homomorphism with kernel $H$.

Proof Let $x, y \in G$. Then

$$
\gamma(x y)=(x y) H=(x H)(y H)=\gamma(x) \gamma(y),
$$

14.10 Figure

so $\gamma$ is a homomorphism. Since $x H=H$ if and only if $x \in H$, we see that the kernel of $\gamma$ is indeed $H$.

We have seen in Theorem 14.1 that if $\phi: G \rightarrow G^{\prime}$ is a homomorphism with kernel $H$, then $\mu: G / H \rightarrow \phi[G]$ where $\mu(g H)=\phi(g)$ is an isomorphism. Theorem 14.9 shows that $\gamma: G \rightarrow G / H$ defined by $\gamma(g)=g H$ is a homomorphism. Figure 14.10 shows these groups and maps. We see that the homomorphism $\phi$ can be factored, $\phi=\mu \gamma$, where $\gamma$ is a homomorphism and $\mu$ is an isomorphism of $G / H$ with $\phi[G]$. We state this as a theorem.

14.11 Theorem (The Fundamental Homomorphism Theorem) Let $\phi: G \rightarrow G^{\prime}$ be a group homomorphism with kernel $H$. Then $\phi[G]$ is a group, and $\mu: G / H \rightarrow \phi[G]$ given by $\mu(g H)=\phi(g)$ is an isomorphism. If $\gamma: G \rightarrow G / H$ is the homomorphism given by $\gamma(g)=g H$, then $\phi(g)=\mu \gamma(g)$ for each $g \in G$.

The isomorphism $\mu$ in Theorem 14.11 is referred to as a natural or canonical isomorphism, and the same adjectives are used to describe the homomorphism $\gamma$. There may be other isomorphisms and homomorphisms for these same groups, but the maps $\mu$ and $\gamma$ have a special status with $\phi$ and are uniquely determined by Theorem 14.11.

In summary, every homomorphism with domain $G$ gives rise to a factor group $G / H$, and every factor group $G / H$ gives rise to a homomorphism mapping $G$ into $G / H$. Homomorphisms and factor groups are closely related. We give an example indicating how useful this relationship can be.

14.12 Example Classify the group $\left(\mathbb{Z}_{4} \times \mathbb{Z}_{2}\right) /\left(\{0\} \times \mathbb{Z}_{2}\right)$ according to the fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups (Theorem 11.12).

Solution The projection map $\pi_{1}: \mathbb{Z}_{4} \times \mathbb{Z}_{2} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_{4}$ given by $\pi_{1}(x, y)=x$ is a homomorphism of $\mathbb{Z}_{4} \times \mathbb{Z}_{2}$ onto $\mathbb{Z}_{4}$ with kernel $\{0\} \times \mathbb{Z}_{2}$. By Theorem 14.11 , we know that the given factor group is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_{4}$.

## Normal Subgroups and Inner Automorphisms

We derive some alternative characterizations of normal subgroups, which often provide us with an easier way to check normality than finding both the left and the right coset decompositions.

Suppose that $H$ is a subgroup of $G$ such that $g h g^{-1} \in H$ for all $g \in G$ and all $h \in H$. Then $g H g^{-1}=\left\{g h g^{-1} \mid h \in H\right\} \subseteq H$ for all $g \in G$. We claim that actually $g \mathrm{Hg}^{-1}=H$. We must show that $H \subseteq g \mathrm{Hg}^{-1}$ for all $g \in G$. Let $h \in H$. Replacing $g$ by $g^{-1}$ in the relation $g h g^{-1} \in H$, we obtain $g^{-1} h\left(g^{-1}\right)^{-1}=g^{-1} h g=h_{1}$ where $h_{1} \in H$. Consequently, $h=g h_{1} g^{-1} \in g \mathrm{Hg}^{-1}$, and we are done.

Suppose that $g H=H g$ for all $g \in G$. Then $g h=h_{1} g$, so $g h g^{-1} \in H$ for all $g \in G$ and all $h \in H$. By the preceding paragraph, this means that $g \mathrm{Hg}^{-1}=H$ for all $g \in G$. Conversely, if $g \mathrm{Hg}^{-1}=H$ for all $g \in G$, then $g h g^{-1}=h_{1}$ so $g h=h_{1} g \in H g$, and $g H \subseteq H g$. But also, $g^{-1} H g=H$ giving $g^{-1} h g=h_{2}$, so that $h g=g h_{2}$ and $H g \subseteq$ $g H$.

We summarize our work as a theorem.

14.13 Theorem The following are three equivalent conditions for a subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ to be a normal subgroup of $G$.

1. $g h g^{-1} \in H$ for all $g \in G$ and $h \in H$.
2. $g H g^{-1}=H$ for all $g \in G$.
3. $g H=H g$ for all $g \in G$.

Condition (2) of Theorem 14.13 is often taken as the definition of a normal subgroup $H$ of a group $G$.

14.14 Example Every subgroup $H$ of an abelian group $G$ is normal. We need only note that $g h=h g$ for all $h \in H$ and all $g \in G$, so, of course, $g h g^{-1}=h \in H$ for all $g \in G$ and all $h \in H$.

Exercise 29 of Section 13 shows that the map $i_{g}: G \rightarrow G$ defined by $i_{g}(x)=g x g^{-1}$ is a homomorphism of $G$ into itself. We see that $\mathrm{gag}^{-1}=g b g^{-1}$ if and only if $a=b$, so $i_{g}$ is one to one. Since $g\left(g^{-1} y g\right) g^{-1}=y$, we see that $i_{g}$ is onto $G$, so it is an isomorphism of $G$ with itself.

14.15 Definition An isomorphism $\phi: G \rightarrow G$ of a group $G$ with itself is an automorphism of $G$. The automorphism $i_{g}: G \rightarrow G$, where $i_{g}(x)=g x g^{-1}$ for all $x \in G$, is the inner automorphism of $G$ by $g$. Performing $i_{g}$ on $x$ is called conjugation of $x$ by $g$.

The equivalence of conditions (1) and (2) in Theorem 14.13 shows that $\mathrm{gH}=\mathrm{Hg}$ for all $g \in G$ if and only if $i_{g}[H]=H$ for all $g \in G$, that is, if and only if $H$ is invariant under all inner automorphisms of $G$. It is important to realize that $i_{g}[H]=H$ is an equation in sets; we need not have $i_{g}(h)=h$ for all $h \in H$. That is $i_{g}$ may perform a nontrivial permutation of the set $H$. We see that the normal subgroups of a group $G$ are precisely those that are invariant under all inner automorphisms. A subgroup $K$ of $G$ is a conjugate subgroup of $H$ if $K=i_{g}[H]$ for some $g \in G$.

Students often write nonsense when first proving theorems about factor groups. The next two exercises are designed to call attention to one basic type of error.

21. A student is asked to show that if $H$ is a normal subgroup of an abelian group $G$, then $G / H$ is abelian. The student's proof starts as follows:

We must show that $G / H$ is abelian. Let $a$ and $b$ be two elements of $G / H$.

We must show that each element of $G / H$ is of finite order. Let $x \in G / H$.

## SEction 15 Factor-Group Computations and Simple Groups

Factor groups can be a tough topic for students to grasp. There is nothing like a bit of computation to strengthen understanding in mathematics. We start by attempting to improve our intuition concerning factor groups. Since we will be dealing with normal subgroups throughout this section, we often denote a subgroup of a group $G$ by $N$ rather than by $H$.

Let $N$ be a normal subgroup of $G$. In the factor group $G / N$, the subgroup $N$ acts as identity element. We may regard $N$ as being collapsed to a single element, either to 0 in additive notation or to $e$ in multiplicative notation. This collapsing of $N$ together with the algebraic structure of $G$ require that other subsets of $G$, namely, the cosets of $N$, also collapse into a single element in the factor group. A visualization of this collapsing is provided by Fig. 15.1. Recall from Theorem 14.9 that $\gamma: G \rightarrow G / N$ defined by $\gamma(a)=a N$ for $a \in G$ is a homomorphism of $G$ onto $G / N$. Figure 15.1 is very similar to Fig. 13.14, but in Fig. 15.1 the image group under the homomorphism is actually formed from $G$. We can view the "line" $G / N$ at the bottom of the figure as obtained by collapsing to a point each coset of $N$ in another copy of $G$. Each point of $G / N$ thus corresponds to a whole vertical line segment in the shaded portion, representing a coset of $N$ in $G$. It is crucial to remember that multiplication of cosets in $G / N$ can be computed by multiplying in $G$, using any representative elements of the cosets as shown in the figure.

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_01_27_9289ad7bed1dd2e5e553g-149.jpg?height=463&width=528&top_left_y=1834&top_left_x=923)

15.1 Figure

Additively, two elements of $G$ will collapse into the same element of $G / N$ if they differ by an element of $N$. Multiplicatively, $a$ and $b$ collapse together if $a b^{-1}$ is in $N$. The degree of collapsing can vary from nonexistent to catastrophic. We illustrate the two extreme cases by examples.

15.2 Example The trivial subgroup $N=\{0\}$ of $\mathbb{Z}$ is, of course, a normal subgroup. Compute $\mathbb{Z} /\{0\}$.

Solution Since $N=\{0\}$ has only one element, every coset of $N$ has only one element. That is, the cosets are of the form $\{m\}$ for $m \in \mathbb{Z}$. There is no collapsing at all, and consequently, $\mathbb{Z} /\{0\} \simeq \mathbb{Z}$. Each $m \in \mathbb{Z}$ is simply renamed $\{m\}$ in $\mathbb{Z} /\{0\}$.

15.3 Example Let $n$ be a positive integer. The set $n \mathbb{R}=\{n r \mid r \in \mathbb{R}\}$ is a subgroup of $\mathbb{R}$ under addition, and it is normal since $\mathbb{R}$ is abelian. Compute $\mathbb{R} / n \mathbb{R}$.

Solution A bit of thought shows that actually $n \mathbb{R}=\mathbb{R}$, because each $x \in \mathbb{R}$ is of the form $n(x / n)$ and $x / n \in \mathbb{R}$. Thus $\mathbb{R} / n \mathbb{R}$ has only one element, the subgroup $n \mathbb{R}$. The factor group is a trivial group consisting only of the identity element.

As illustrated in Examples 15.2 and 15.3 for any group $G$, we have $G /\{e\} \simeq G$ and $G / G \simeq\{e\}$, where $\{e\}$ is the trivial group consisting only of the identity element $e$. These two extremes of factor groups are of little importance. We would like knowledge of a factor group $G / N$ to give some information about the structure of $G$. If $N=\{e\}$, the factor group has the same structure as $G$ and we might as well have tried to study $G$ directly. If $N=G$, the factor group has no significant structure to supply information about $G$. If $G$ is a finite group and $N \neq\{e\}$ is a normal subgroup of $G$, then $G / N$ is a smaller group than $G$, and consequently may have a more simple structure than $G$. The multiplication of cosets in $G / N$ reflects the multiplication in $G$, since products of cosets can be computed by multiplying in $G$ representative elements of the cosets.

We give two examples showing that even when $G / N$ has order 2 , we may be able to deduce some useful results. If $G$ is a finite group and $G / N$ has just two elements, then we must have $|G|=2|N|$. Note that every subgroup $H$ containing just half the elements of a finite group $G$ must be a normal subgroup, since for each element $a$ in $G$ but not in $H$, both the left coset $a H$ and the right coset $H a$ must consist of all elements in $G$ that are not in $H$. Thus the left and right cosets of $H$ coincide and $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$.

15.4 Example

Because $\left|S_{n}\right|=2\left|A_{n}\right|$, we see that $A_{n}$ is a normal subgroup of $S_{n}$, and $S_{n} / A_{n}$ has order 2 . Let $\sigma$ be an odd permutation in $S_{n}$, so that $S_{n} / A_{n}=\left\{A_{n}, \sigma A_{n}\right\}$. Renaming the element $A_{n}$ "even" and the element $\sigma A_{n}$ "odd," the multiplication in $S_{n} / A_{n}$ shown in Table 15.5 becomes

### 15.5 Table

|  | $A_{n}$ | $\sigma A_{n}$ |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| $A_{n}$ | $A_{n}$ | $\sigma A_{n}$ |
| $\sigma A_{n}$ | $\sigma A_{n}$ | $A_{n}$ |

$$
\begin{array}{rlrlrl}
(\text { even })(\text { even }) & =\text { even } & & (\text { odd })(\text { even }) & =\text { odd } \\
(\text { even })(\text { odd }) & =\text { odd } & (\text { odd })(\text { odd }) & =\text { even. }
\end{array}
$$

Thus the factor group reflects these multiplicative properties for all the permutations in $S_{n}$.

Example 15.4 illustrates that while knowing the product of two cosets in $G / N$ does not tell us what the product of two elements of $G$ is, it may tell us that the product in $G$ of two types of elements is itself of a certain type.

15.6 Example (Falsity of the Converse of the Theorem of Lagrange) The theorem of Lagrange states if $H$ is a subgroup of a finite group $G$, then the order of $H$ divides the order of $G$. We show that it is false that if $d$ divides the order of $G$, then there must exist a subgroup $H$ of $G$ having order $d$. Namely, we show that $A_{4}$, which has order 12, contains no subgroup of order 6.

Suppose that $H$ were a subgroup of $A_{4}$ having order 6 . As observed before in Example 15.4, it would follow that $H$ would be a normal subgroup of $A_{4}$. Then $A_{4} / H$ would have only two elements, $H$ and $\sigma H$ for some $\sigma \in A_{4}$ not in $H$. Since in a group of order 2, the square of each element is the identity, we would have $H H=H$ and $(\sigma H)(\sigma H)=H$. Now computation in a factor group can be achieved by computing with representatives in the original group. Thus, computing in $A_{4}$, we find that for each $\alpha \in H$ we must have $\alpha^{2} \in H$ and for each $\beta \in \sigma H$ we must have $\beta^{2} \in H$. That is, the square of every element in $A_{4}$ must be in $H$. But in $A_{4}$, we have

$$
(1,2,3)=(1,3,2)^{2} \text { and }(1,3,2)=(1,2,3)^{2}
$$

so $(1,2,3)$ and $(1,3,2)$ are in $H$. A similar computation shows that $(1,2,4),(1,4,2)$, $(1,3,4),(1,4,3),(2,3,4)$, and $(2,4,3)$ are all in $H$. This shows that there must be at least 8 elements in $H$, contradicting the fact that $H$ was supposed to have order 6 .

We now turn to several examples that compute factor groups. If the group we start with is finitely generated and abelian, then its factor group will be also. Computing such a factor group means classifying it according to the fundamental theorem (Theorem 11.12).

15.7 Example Let us compute the factor group $\left(\mathbb{Z}_{4} \times \mathbb{Z}_{6}\right) /\langle(0,1)\rangle$. Here $\langle(0,1)\rangle$ is the cyclic subgroup $H$ of $\mathbb{Z}_{4} \times \mathbb{Z}_{6}$ generated by $(0,1)$. Thus

$$
H=\{(0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(0,4),(0,5)\} .
$$

Since $\mathbb{Z}_{4} \times \mathbb{Z}_{6}$ has 24 elements and $H$ has 6 elements, all cosets of $H$ must have 6 elements, and $\left(\mathbb{Z}_{4} \times \mathbb{Z}_{6}\right) / H$ must have order 4 . Since $\mathbb{Z}_{4} \times \mathbb{Z}_{6}$ is abelian, so is $\left(\mathbb{Z}_{4} \times \mathbb{Z}_{6}\right) / H$ (remember, we compute in a factor group by means of representatives from the original group). In additive notation, the cosets are

$$
H=(0,0)+H, \quad(1,0)+H, \quad(2,0)+H, \quad(3,0)+H
$$

Since we can compute by choosing the representatives $(0,0),(1,0),(2,0)$, and $(3,0)$, it is clear that $\left(\mathbb{Z}_{4} \times \mathbb{Z}_{6}\right) / H$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_{4}$. Note that this is what we would expect, since in a factor group modulo $H$, everything in $H$ becomes the identity element; that is, we are essentially setting everything in $H$ equal to zero. Thus the whole second factor $\mathbb{Z}_{6}$ of $\mathbb{Z}_{4} \times \mathbb{Z}_{6}$ is collapsed, leaving just the first factor $\mathbb{Z}_{4}$.

Example 15.7 is a special case of a general theorem that we now state and prove. We should acquire an intuitive feeling for this theorem in terms of collapsing one of the factors to the identity element.

15.8 Theorem Let $G=H \times K$ be the direct product of groups $H$ and $K$. Then $\bar{H}=\{(h, e) \mid h \in H\}$ is a normal subgroup of $G$. Also $G / \bar{H}$ is isomorphic to $K$ in a natural way. Similarly, $G / \bar{K} \simeq H$ in a natural way.

Proof Consider the homomorphism $\pi_{2}: H \times K \rightarrow K$, where $\pi_{2}(h, k)=k$. (See Example 13.8). Because $\operatorname{Ker}\left(\pi_{2}\right)=\bar{H}$, we see that $\bar{H}$ is a normal subgroup of $H \times K$. Because $\pi_{2}$ is onto $K$, Theorem 14.11 tells us that $(H \times K) / \bar{H} \simeq K$.

We continue with additional computations of abelian factor groups. To illustrate how easy it is to compute in a factor group if we can compute in the whole group, we prove the following theorem.

15.9 Theorem A factor group of a cyclic group is cyclic.

Proof Let $G$ be cyclic with generator $a$, and let $N$ be a normal subgroup of $G$. We claim the coset $a N$ generates $G / N$. We must compute all powers of $a N$. But this amounts to computing, in $G$, all powers of the representative $a$ and all these powers give all elements in $G$. Hence the powers of $a N$ certainly give all cosets of $N$ and $G / N$ is cyclic.

15.10 Example Let us compute the factor group $\left(\mathbb{Z}_{4} \times \mathbb{Z}_{6}\right) /\langle(0,2)\rangle$. Now $(0,2)$ generates the subgroup

$$
H=\{(0,0),(0,2),(0,4)\}
$$

of $\mathbb{Z}_{4} \times \mathbb{Z}_{6}$ of order 3 . Here the first factor $\mathbb{Z}_{4}$ of $\mathbb{Z}_{4} \times \mathbb{Z}_{6}$ is left alone. The $\mathbb{Z}_{6}$ factor, on the other hand, is essentially collapsed by a subgroup of order 3 , giving a factor group in the second factor of order 2 that must be isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$. Thus $\left(\mathbb{Z}_{4} \times \mathbb{Z}_{6}\right) /\langle(0,2)\rangle$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_{4} \times \mathbb{Z}_{2}$.

15.11 Example Let us compute the factor group $\left(\mathbb{Z}_{4} \times \mathbb{Z}_{6}\right) /\langle(2,3)\rangle$. Be careful! There is a great temptation to say that we are setting the 2 of $\mathbb{Z}_{4}$ and the 3 of $\mathbb{Z}_{6}$ both equal to zero, so that $\mathbb{Z}_{4}$ is collapsed to a factor group isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_{6}$ to one isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_{3}$, giving a total factor group isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_{2} \times \mathbb{Z}_{3}$. This is wrong! Note that

$$
H=\langle(2,3)\rangle=\{(0,0),(2,3)\}
$$

is of order 2 , so $\left(\mathbb{Z}_{4} \times \mathbb{Z}_{6}\right) /\langle(2,3)\rangle$ has order 12 , not 6 . Setting $(2,3)$ equal to zero does not make $(2,0)$ and $(0,3)$ equal to zero individually, so the factors do not collapse separately.

The possible abelian groups of order 12 are $\mathbb{Z}_{4} \times \mathbb{Z}_{3}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_{2} \times \mathbb{Z}_{2} \times \mathbb{Z}_{3}$, and we must decide to which one our factor group is isomorphic. These two groups are most easily distinguished in that $\mathbb{Z}_{4} \times \mathbb{Z}_{3}$ has an element of order 4 , and $\mathbb{Z}_{2} \times \mathbb{Z}_{2} \times \mathbb{Z}_{3}$ does not. We claim that the coset $(1,0)+H$ is of order 4 in the factor group $\left(\mathbb{Z}_{4} \times \mathbb{Z}_{6}\right) / H$. To find the smallest power of a coset giving the identity in a factor group modulo $H$, we must, by choosing representatives, find the smallest power of a representative that is in the subgroup $H$. Now,

$$
4(1,0)=(1,0)+(1,0)+(1,0)+(1,0)=(0,0)
$$

is the first time that $(1,0)$ added to itself gives an element of $H$. Thus $\left(\mathbb{Z}_{4} \times \mathbb{Z}_{6}\right) /\langle(2,3)\rangle$ has an element of order 4 and is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_{4} \times \mathbb{Z}_{3}$ or $\mathbb{Z}_{12}$.

15.12 Example Let us compute (that is, classify as in Theorem 11.12 the group $(\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}) /\langle(1,1)\rangle$. We may visualize $\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}$ as the points in the plane with both coordinates integers, as indicated by the dots in Fig. 15.13. The subgroup $\langle(1,1)\rangle$ consists of those points that lie on the $45^{\circ}$ line through the origin, indicated in the figure. The coset $(1,0)+\langle(1,1)\rangle$ consists of those dots on the $45^{\circ}$ line through the point $(1,0)$, also shown in the figure. Continuing, we see that each coset consists of those dots lying on one of the $45^{\circ}$ lines in the figure. We may choose the representatives

$$
\cdots,(-3,0),(-2,0),(-1,0),(0,0),(1,0),(2,0),(3,0), \cdots
$$

of these cosets to compute in the factor group. Since these representatives correspond precisely to the points of $\mathbb{Z}$ on the $x$-axis, we see that the factor group $(\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}) /\langle(1,1)\rangle$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}$.

## Simple Groups

As we mentioned in the preceding section, one feature of a factor group is that it gives crude information about the structure of the whole group. Of course, sometimes there may be no nontrivial proper normal subgroups. For example, Theorem 10.10 shows that a group of prime order can have no nontrivial proper subgroups of any sort.

15.14 Definition A group is simple if it is nontrivial and has no proper nontrivial normal subgroups.

15.15 Theorem The alternating group $A_{n}$ is simple for $n \geq 5$.

Proof See Exercise 39.

There are many simple groups other than those given above. For example, $A_{5}$ is of order 60 and $A_{6}$ is of order 360 , and there is a simple group of nonprime order, namely 168 , between these orders.

The complete determination and classification of all finite simple groups were recently completed. Hundreds of mathematicians worked on this task from 1950 to 1980. It can be shown that a finite group has a sort of factorization into simple groups, where the factors are unique up to order. The situation is similar to the factorization of positive integers into primes. The new knowledge of all finite simple groups can now be used to solve some problems of finite group theory.

We have seen in this text that a finite simple abelian group is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ for some prime $p$. In 1963, Thompson and Feit [21] published their proof of a longstanding conjecture of Burnside, showing that every finite nonabelian simple group is of even order. Further great strides toward the complete classification were made by Aschbacher in the 1970s. Early in 1980, Griess announced that he had constructed a predicted "monster" simple group of order

$808,017,424,794,512,875,886,459,904,961,710,757,005,754,368$,

$000,000,000$.

Aschbacher added the final details of the classification in August 1980. The research papers contributing to the entire classification fill roughly 5000 journal pages.

We turn to the characterization of those normal subgroups $N$ of a group $G$ for which $G / N$ is a simple group. First we state an addendum to Theorem 13.12 on properties of a group homomorphism. The proof is left to Exercises 35 and 36.

15.16 Theorem Let $\phi: G \rightarrow G^{\prime}$ be a group homomorphism. If $N$ is a normal subgroup of $G$, then $\phi[N]$ is a normal subgroup of $\phi[G]$. Also, if $N^{\prime}$ is a normal subgroup of $\phi[G]$, then $\phi^{-1}\left[N^{\prime}\right]$ is a normal subgroup of $G$.

Theorem 15.16 should be viewed as saying that a homomorphism $\phi: G \rightarrow G^{\prime}$ preserves normal subgroups between $G$ and $\phi[G]$. It is important to note that $\phi[N]$ may not be normal in $G^{\prime}$, even though $N$ is normal in $G$. For example, $\phi: \mathbb{Z}_{2} \rightarrow S_{3}$, where $\phi(0)=\rho_{0}$ and $\phi(1)=\mu_{1}$ is a homomorphism, and $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ is a normal subgroup of itself, but $\left\{\rho_{0}, \mu_{1}\right\}$ is not a normal subgroup of $S_{3}$.

We can now characterize when $G / N$ is a simple group.

15.17 Definition A maximal normal subgroup of a group $G$ is a normal subgroup $M$ not equal to $G$ such that there is no proper normal subgroup $N$ of $G$ properly containing $M$.

15.18 Theorem $\quad M$ is a maximal normal subgroup of $G$ if and only if $G / M$ is simple.

Proof Let $M$ be a maximal normal subgroup of $G$. Consider the canonical homomorphism $\gamma: G \rightarrow G / M$ given by Theorem 14.9. Now $\gamma^{-1}$ of any nontrivial proper normal subgroup of $G / M$ is a proper normal subgroup of $G$ properly containing $M$. But $M$ is maximal, so this can not happen. Thus $G / M$ is simple.

Conversely, Theorem 15.16 shows that if $N$ is a normal subgroup of $G$ properly containing $M$, then $\gamma[N]$ is normal in $G / M$. If also $N \neq G$, then

$$
\gamma[N] \neq G / M \quad \text { and } \quad \gamma[N] \neq\{M\}
$$

Thus, if $G / M$ is simple so that no such $\gamma[N]$ can exist, no such $N$ can exist, and $M$ is maximal.

## The Center and Commutator Subgroups

Every nonabelian group $G$ has two important normal subgroups, the center $Z(G)$ of $G$ and the commutator subgroup $C$ of $G$. (The letter $Z$ comes from the German word zentrum, meaning center.) The center $Z(G)$ is defined by

$$
Z(G)=\{z \in G \mid z g=g z \text { for all } g \in G\} \text {. }
$$

Exercise 52 of Section 5 shows that $Z(G)$ is an abelian subgroup of $G$. Since for each $g \in$ $G$ and $z \in Z(G)$ we have $g z g^{-1}=z g g^{-1}=z e=z$, we see at once that $Z(G)$ is a normal subgroup of $G$. If $G$ is abelian, then $Z(G)=G$; in this case, the center is not useful.

15.19 Example The center of a group $G$ always contains the identity element $e$. It may be that $Z(G)=\{e\}$, in which case we say that the center of $G$ is trivial. For example, examination of Table 8.8 for the group $S_{3}$ shows us that $Z\left(S_{3}\right)=\left\{\rho_{0}\right\}$, so the center of $S_{3}$ is trivial. (This is a special case of Exercise 38, which shows that the center of every nonabelian group of order $p q$ for primes $p$ and $q$ is trivial.) Consequently, the center of $S_{3} \times \mathbb{Z}_{5}$ must be $\left\{\rho_{0}\right\} \times \mathbb{Z}_{5}$, which is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_{5}$.

Turning to the commutator subgroup, recall that in forming a factor group of $G$ modulo a normal subgroup $N$, we are essentially putting every element in $G$ that is in $N$ equal to $e$, for $N$ forms our new identity in the factor group. This indicates another use for factor groups. Suppose, for example, that we are studying the structure of a nonabelian group $G$. Since Theorem 11.12 gives complete information about the structure of all sufficiently small abelian groups, it might be of interest to try to form an abelian group as much like $G$ as possible, an abelianized version of $G$, by starting with $G$ and then requiring that $a b=b a$ for all $a$ and $b$ in our new group structure. To require that $a b=b a$ is to say that $a b a^{-1} b^{-1}=e$ in our new group. An element $a b a^{-1} b^{-1}$ in a group is a commutator of the group. Thus we wish to attempt to form an abelianized version of $G$ by replacing every commutator of $G$ by $e$. By the first observation of this paragraph, we should then attempt to form the factor group of $G$ modulo the smallest normal subgroup we can find that contains all commutators of $G$.

15.20 Theorem Let $G$ be a group. The set of all commutators $a b a^{-1} b^{-1}$ for $a, b \in G$ generates a subgroup $C$ (the commutator subgroup) of $G$. This subgroup $C$ is a normal subgroup of $G$. Furthermore, if $N$ is a normal subgroup of $G$, then $G / N$ is abelian if and only if $C \leq N$.

Proof The commutators certainly generate a subgroup $C$; we must show that it is normal in $G$. Note that the inverse $\left(a b a^{-1} b^{-1}\right)^{-1}$ of a commutator is again a commutator, namely, $b a b^{-1} a^{-1}$. Also $e=e e e^{-1} e^{-1}$ is a commutator. Theorem 7.6 then shows that $C$ consists precisely of all finite products of commutators. For $x \in C$, we must show that $g^{-1} x g \in C$ for all $g \in G$, or that if $x$ is a product of commutators, so is $g^{-1} x g$ for all $g \in G$. By inserting $e=g g^{-1}$ between each product of commutators occurring in $x$, we see that it is sufficient to show for each commutator $c d c^{-1} d^{-1}$ that $g^{-1}\left(c d c^{-1} d^{-1}\right) g$ is in $C$. But

$$
\begin{aligned}
g^{-1}\left(c d c^{-1} d^{-1}\right) g & =\left(g^{-1} c d c^{-1}\right)(e)\left(d^{-1} g\right) \\
& =\left(g^{-1} c d c^{-1}\right)\left(g d^{-1} d g^{-1}\right)\left(d^{-1} g\right) \\
& =\left[\left(g^{-1} c\right) d\left(g^{-1} c\right)^{-1} d^{-1}\right]\left[d g^{-1} d^{-1} g\right]
\end{aligned}
$$

which is in $C$. Thus $C$ is normal in $G$.

The rest of the theorem is obvious if we have acquired the proper feeling for factor groups. One doesn't visualize in this way, but writing out that $G / C$ is abelian follows from

$$
\begin{aligned}
(a C)(b C) & =a b C=a b\left(b^{-1} a^{-1} b a\right) C \\
& =\left(a b b^{-1} a^{-1}\right) b a C=b a C=(b C)(a C) .
\end{aligned}
$$

Furthermore, if $N$ is a normal subgroup of $G$ and $G / N$ is abelian, then $\left(a^{-1} N\right)\left(b^{-1} N\right)=$ $\left(b^{-1} N\right)\left(a^{-1} N\right)$; that is, $a b a^{-1} b^{-1} N=N$, so $a b a^{-1} b^{-1} \in N$, and $C \leq N$. Finally, if $C \leq N$, then

$$
\begin{aligned}
(a N)(b N) & =a b N=a b\left(b^{-1} a^{-1} b a\right) N \\
& =\left(a b b^{-1} a^{-1}\right) b a N=b a N=(b N)(a N) .
\end{aligned}
$$

15.21 Example

For the group $S_{3}$ in Table 8.8, we find that one commutator is $\rho_{1} \mu_{1} \rho_{1}^{-1} \mu_{1}^{-1}=\rho_{1} \mu_{1} \rho_{2} \mu_{1}$ $=\mu_{3} \mu_{2}=\rho_{2}$. We similarly find that $\rho_{2} \mu_{1} \rho_{2}^{-1} \mu_{1}^{-1}=\rho_{2} \mu_{1} \rho_{1} \mu_{1}=\mu_{2} \mu_{3}=\rho_{1}$. Thus the commutator subgroup $C$ of $S_{3}$ contains $A_{3}$. Since $A_{3}$ is a normal subgroup of $S_{3}$ and $S_{3} / A_{3}$ is abelian, Theorem 15.20 shows that $C=A_{3}$.

c. Let $r$ and $s$ be fixed elements of $\{1,2, \cdots, n\}$ for $n \geq 3$. Show that $A_{n}$ is generated by the $n$ "special" 3 -cycles of the form $(r, s, i)$ for $1 \leq i \leq n$ [Hint: Show every 3-cycle is the product of "special" 3-cycles by computing

$$
(r, s, i)^{2}, \quad(r, s, j)(r, s, i)^{2}, \quad(r, s, j)^{2}(r, s, i),

Case IV $N$ contains a disjoint product of the form $\sigma=\mu\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}\right)$ where $\mu$ is a product of disjoint 2-cycles. [Hint: Show $\sigma^{2} \in N$ and compute it.]

Case $\mathbf{V} N$ contains a disjoint product $\sigma$ of the form $\sigma=\mu\left(a_{3}, a_{4}\right)\left(a_{1}, a_{2}\right)$, where $\mu$ is a product of an even number of disjoint 2-cycles. [Hint: Show that $\sigma^{-1}\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}\right) \sigma\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}\right)^{-1}$ is in $N$, and compute it to deduce that $\alpha=\left(a_{2}, a_{4}\right)\left(a_{1}, a_{3}\right)$ is in $N$. Using $n \geq 5$ for the first time, find $i \neq a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, a_{4}$ in $\{1,2, \cdots, n\}$. Let $\beta=\left(a_{1}, a_{3}, i\right)$. Show that $\beta^{-1} \alpha \beta \alpha \in N$, and compute it.]

40. Let $N$ be a normal subgroup of $G$ and let $H$ be any subgroup of $G$. Let $H N=\{h n \mid h \in H, n \in N\}$. Show that $H N$ is a subgroup of $G$, and is the smallest subgroup containing both $N$ and $H$.

We have seen examples of how groups may act on things, like the group of symmetries of a triangle or of a square, the group of rotations of a cube, the general linear group acting on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, and so on. In this section, we give the general notion of group action on a set. The next section will give an application to counting.

## The Notion of a Group Action

Definition 2.1 defines a binary operation $*$ on a set $S$ to be a function mapping $S \times S$ into $S$. The function $*$ gives us a rule for "multiplying" an element $s_{1}$ in $S$ and an element $s_{2}$ in $S$ to yield an element $s_{1} * s_{2}$ in $S$.

More generally, for any sets $A, B$, and $C$, we can view a map $*: A \times B \rightarrow C$ as defining a "multiplication," where any element $a$ of $A$ times any element $b$ of $B$ has as value some element $c$ of $C$. Of course, we write $a * b=c$, or simply $a b=c$. In this section, we will be concerned with the case where $X$ is a set, $G$ is a group, and we have a map $*: G \times X \rightarrow X$. We shall write $*(g, x)$ as $g * x$ or $g x$.

16.1 Definition Let $X$ be a set and $G$ a group. An action of $G$ on $X$ is a map $*: G \times X \rightarrow X$ such that

1. $e x=x$ for all $x \in X$,
2. $\left(g_{1} g_{2}\right)(x)=g_{1}\left(g_{2} x\right)$ for all $x \in X$ and all $g_{1}, g_{2} \in G$.

Under these conditions, $X$ is a $G$-set.[^9]

16.2 Example Let $X$ be any set, and let $H$ be a subgroup of the group $S_{X}$ of all permutations of $X$. Then $X$ is an $H$-set, where the action of $\sigma \in H$ on $X$ is its action as an element of $S_{X}$, so that $\sigma x=\sigma(x)$ for all $x \in X$. Condition 2 is a consequence of the definition of permutation multiplication as function composition, and Condition 1 is immediate from the definition of the identity permutation as the identity function. Note that, in particular, $\{1,2,3, \cdots, n\}$ is an $S_{n}$-set.

Our next theorem will show that for every $G$-set $X$ and each $g \in G$, the map $\sigma_{g}: X \rightarrow X$ defined by $\sigma_{g}(x)=g x$ is a permutation of $X$, and that there is a homomorphism $\phi: G \rightarrow S_{X}$ such that the action of $G$ on $X$ is essentially the Example 16.2 action of the image subgroup $H=\phi[G]$ of $S_{X}$ on $X$. So actions of subgroups of $S_{X}$ on $X$ describe all possible group actions on $X$. When studying the set $X$, actions using subgroups of $S_{X}$ suffice. However, sometimes a set $X$ is used to study $G$ via a group action of $G$ on $X$. Thus we need the more general concept given by Definition 16.1.

16.3 Theorem Let $X$ be a $G$-set. For each $g \in G$, the function $\sigma_{g}: X \rightarrow X$ defined by $\sigma_{g}(x)=g x$ for $x \in X$ is a permutation of $X$. Also, the map $\phi: G \rightarrow S_{X}$ defined by $\phi(g)=\sigma_{g}$ is a homomorphism with the property that $\phi(g)(x)=g x$.

Proof To show that $\sigma_{g}$ is a permutation of $X$, we must show that it is a one-to-one map of $X$ onto itself. Suppose that $\sigma_{g}\left(x_{1}\right)=\sigma_{g}\left(x_{2}\right)$ for $x_{1}, x_{2} \in X$. Then $g x_{1}=g x_{2}$. Consequently, $g^{-1}\left(g x_{1}\right)=g^{-1}\left(g x_{2}\right)$. Using Condition 2 in Definition 16.1, we see that $\left(g^{-1} g\right) x_{1}=\left(g^{-1} g\right) x_{2}$, so $e x_{1}=e x_{2}$. Condition 1 of the definition then yields $x_{1}=x_{2}$, so $\sigma_{g}$ is one to one. The two conditions of the definition show that for $x \in X$, we have $\sigma_{g}\left(g^{-1} x\right)=g\left(g^{-1}\right) x=\left(g g^{-1}\right) x=e x=x$, so $\sigma_{g}$ maps $X$ onto $X$. Thus $\sigma_{g}$ is indeed a permutation.

To show that $\phi: G \rightarrow S_{X}$ defined by $\phi(g)=\sigma_{g}$ is a homomorphism, we must show that $\phi\left(g_{1} g_{2}\right)=\phi\left(g_{1}\right) \phi\left(g_{2}\right)$ for all $g_{1}, g_{2} \in G$. We show the equality of these two permutations in $S_{X}$ by showing they both carry an $x \in X$ into the same element. Using the two conditions in Definition 16.1 and the rule for function composition, we obtain

$$
\begin{aligned}
\phi\left(g_{1} g_{2}\right)(x) & =\sigma_{g_{1} g_{2}}(x)=\left(g_{1} g_{2}\right) x=g_{1}\left(g_{2} x\right)=g_{1} \sigma_{g_{2}}(x)=\sigma_{g_{1}}\left(\sigma_{g_{2}}(x)\right) \\
& =\left(\sigma_{g_{1}} \circ \sigma_{g_{2}}\right)(x)=\left(\sigma_{g_{1}} \sigma_{g_{2}}\right)(x)=\left(\phi\left(g_{1}\right) \phi\left(g_{2}\right)\right)(x)
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus $\phi$ is a homomorphism. The stated property of $\phi$ follows at once since by our definitions, we have $\phi(g)(x)=\sigma_{g}(x)=g x$.

It follows from the preceding theorem and Corollary 13.20 that if $X$ is a $G$-set, then the subset of $G$ leaving every element of $X$ fixed is a normal subgroup $N$ of $G$, and we can regard $X$ as a $G / N$-set where the action of a coset $g N$ on $X$ is given by $(g N) x=g x$ for each $x \in X$. If $N=\{e\}$, then the identity element of $G$ is the only element that leaves every $x \in X$ fixed; we then say that $G$ acts faithfully on $X$. A group $G$ is transitive on a $G$-set $X$ if for each $x_{1}, x_{2} \in X$, there exists $g \in G$ such that $g x_{1}=x_{2}$. Note that $G$ is transitive on $X$ if and only if the subgroup $\phi[G]$ of $S_{X}$ is transitive on $X$, as defined in Exercise 49 of Section 8.

We continue with more examples of $G$-sets.

16.4 Example Every group $G$ is itself a $G$-set, where the action on $g_{2} \in G$ by $g_{1} \in G$ is given by left multiplication. That is, $*\left(g_{1}, g_{2}\right)=g_{1} g_{2}$. If $H$ is a subgroup of $G$, we can also regard $G$ as an $H$-set, where $*(h, g)=h g$.

16.5 Example Let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$. Then $G$ is an $H$-set under conjugation where $*(h, g)=h g h^{-1}$ for $g \in G$ and $h \in H$. Condition 1 is obvious, and for Condition 2 note that

$$
*\left(h_{1} h_{2}, g\right)=\left(h_{1} h_{2}\right) g\left(h_{1} h_{2}\right)^{-1}=h_{1}\left(h_{2} g h_{2}^{-1}\right) h_{1}^{-1}=*\left(h_{1}, *\left(h_{2}, g\right)\right)
$$

We always write this action of $H$ on $G$ by conjugation as $h g h^{-1}$. The abbreviation $h g$ described before the definition would cause terrible confusion with the group operation of $G$.

16.6 Example For students who have studied vector spaces with real (or complex) scalars, we mention that the axioms $(r s) \mathbf{v}=r(s \mathbf{v})$ and $1 \mathbf{v}=\mathbf{v}$ for scalars $r$ and $s$ and a vector $\mathbf{v}$ show that the set of vectors is an $\mathbb{R}^{*}$-set (or a $\mathbb{C}^{*}$-set) for the multiplicative group of nonzero scalars.

16.7 Example Let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$, and let $L_{H}$ be the set of all left cosets of $H$. Then $L_{H}$ is a $G$-set, where the action of $g \in G$ on the left $\operatorname{coset} x H$ is given by $g(x H)=(g x) H$. Observe that this action is well defined: if $y H=x H$, then $y=x h$ for some $h \in H$, and $g(y H)=(g y) H=(g x h) H=(g x)(h H)=(g x) H=g(x H)$. A series of exercises shows that every $G$-set is isomorphic to one that may be formed using these left coset $G$-sets as building blocks. (See Exercises 14 through 17.)

16.8 Example Let $G$ be the group $D_{4}=\left\{\rho_{0}, \rho_{1}, \rho_{2}, \rho_{3}, \mu_{1}, \mu_{2}, \delta_{1}, \delta_{2}\right\}$ of symmetries of the square, described in Example 8.10. In Fig. 16.9 we show the square with vertices 1, 2, 3, 4 as in Fig. 8.11. We also label the sides $s_{1}, s_{2}, s_{3}, s_{4}$, the diagonals $d_{1}$ and $d_{2}$, vertical and horizontal axes $m_{1}$ and $m_{2}$, the center point $C$, and midpoints $P_{i}$ of the sides $s_{i}$. Recall that $\rho_{i}$ corresponds to rotating the square counterclockwise through $\pi i / 2$ radians, $\mu_{i}$

corresponds to flipping on the axis $m_{i}$, and $\delta_{i}$ to flipping on the diagonal $d_{i}$. We let

$$
X=\left\{1,2,3,4, s_{1}, s_{2}, s_{3}, s_{4}, m_{1}, m_{2}, d_{1}, d_{2}, C, P_{1}, P_{2}, P_{3}, P_{4}\right\} .
$$

Then $X$ can be regarded as a $D_{4}$-set in a natural way. Table 16.10 describes completely the action of $D_{4}$ on $X$ and is given to provide geometric illustrations of ideas to be introduced. We should be sure that we understand how this table is formed before continuing.

## Isotropy Subgroups

Let $X$ be a $G$-set. Let $x \in X$ and $g \in G$. It will be important to know when $g x=x$. We let

$$
X_{g}=\{x \in X \mid g x=x\} \quad \text { and } \quad G_{x}=\{g \in G \mid g x=x\} \text {. }
$$

16.11 Example For the $D_{4}$-set $X$ in Example 16.8, we have

$$
X_{\rho_{0}}=X, \quad X_{\rho_{1}}=\{C\}, \quad X_{\mu_{1}}=\left\{s_{1}, s_{3}, m_{1}, m_{2}, C, P_{1}, P_{3}\right\}
$$

Also, with $G=D_{4}$,

$$
G_{1}=\left\{\rho_{0}, \delta_{2}\right\}, \quad G_{s_{3}}=\left\{\rho_{0}, \mu_{1}\right\}, \quad G_{d_{1}}=\left\{\rho_{0}, \rho_{2}, \delta_{1}, \delta_{2}\right\} .
$$

We leave the computation of the other $X_{\sigma}$ and $G_{x}$ to Exercises 1 and 2.

Note that the subsets $G_{x}$ given in the preceding example were, in each case, subgroups of $G$. This is true in general.

16.12 Theorem Let $X$ be a $G$-set. Then $G_{x}$ is a subgroup of $G$ for each $x \in X$.

Proof Let $x \in X$ and let $g_{1}, g_{2} \in G_{x}$. Then $g_{1} x=x$ and $g_{2} x=x$. Consequently, $\left(g_{1} g_{2}\right) x=$ $g_{1}\left(g_{2} x\right)=g_{1} x=x$, so $g_{1} g_{2} \in G_{x}$, and $G_{x}$ is closed under the induced operation of $G$. Of course $e x=x$, so $e \in G_{x}$. If $g \in G_{x}$, then $g x=x$, so $x=e x=\left(g^{-1} g\right) x=g^{-1}(g x)=$ $g^{-1} x$, and consequently $g^{-1} \in G_{x}$. Thus $G_{x}$ is a subgroup of $G$.

16.13 Definition Let $X$ be a $G$-set and let $x \in X$. The subgroup $G_{x}$ is the isotropy subgroup of $x$.

## Orbits

For the $D_{4}$-set $X$ of Example 16.8 with action table in Table 16.10, the elements in the subset $\{1,2,3,4\}$ are carried into elements of this same subset under action by $D_{4}$. Furthermore, each of the elements $1,2,3$, and 4 is carried into all the other elements of the subset by the various elements of $D_{4}$. We proceed to show that every $G$-set $X$ can be partitioned into subsets of this type.

16.14 Theorem Let $X$ be a $G$-set. For $x_{1}, x_{2} \in X$, let $x_{1} \sim x_{2}$ if and only if there exists $g \in G$ such that $g x_{1}=x_{2}$. Then $\sim$ is an equivalence relation on $X$.

Proof For each $x \in X$, we have $e x=x$, so $x \sim x$ and $\sim$ is reflexive.

Suppose $x_{1} \sim x_{2}$, so $g x_{1}=x_{2}$ for some $g \in G$. Then $g^{-1} x_{2}=g^{-1}\left(g x_{1}\right)=$ $\left(g^{-1} g\right) x_{1}=e x_{1}=x_{1}$, so $x_{2} \sim x_{1}$, and $\sim$ is symmetric.

Finally, if $x_{1} \sim x_{2}$ and $x_{2} \sim x_{3}$, then $g_{1} x_{1}=x_{2}$ and $g_{2} x_{2}=x_{3}$ for some $g_{1}, g_{2} \in G$. Then $\left(g_{2} g_{1}\right) x_{1}=g_{2}\left(g_{1} x_{1}\right)=g_{2} x_{2}=x_{3}$, so $x_{1} \sim x_{3}$ and $\sim$ is transitive.

16.15 Definition Let $X$ be a $G$-set. Each cell in the partition of the equivalence relation described in Theorem 16.14 is an orbit in $X$ under $G$. If $x \in X$, the cell containing $x$ is the orbit of $x$. We let this cell be $G x$.

The relationship between the orbits in $X$ and the group structure of $G$ lies at the heart of the applications that appear in Section 17. The following theorem gives this relationship. Recall that for a set $X$, we use $|X|$ for the number of elements in $X$, and $(G: H)$ is the index of a subgroup $H$ in a group $G$.

16.16 Theorem Let $X$ be a $G$-set and let $x \in X$. Then $|G x|=\left(G: G_{x}\right)$. If $|G|$ is finite, then $|G x|$ is a divisor of $|G|$.

Proof We define a one-to-one map $\psi$ from $G x$ onto the collection of left cosets of $G_{x}$ in $G$. Let $x_{1} \in G x$. Then there exists $g_{1} \in G$ such that $g_{1} x=x_{1}$. We define $\psi\left(x_{1}\right)$ to be the left coset $g_{1} G_{x}$ of $G_{x}$. We must show that this map $\psi$ is well defined, independent of the choice of $g_{1} \in G$ such that $g_{1} x=x_{1}$. Suppose also that $g_{1}{ }^{\prime} x=x_{1}$. Then, $g_{1} x=g_{1}{ }^{\prime} x$, so $g_{1}^{-1}\left(g_{1} x\right)=g_{1}^{-1}\left(g_{1}^{\prime} x\right)$, from which we deduce $x=\left(g_{1}^{-1} g_{1}{ }^{\prime}\right) x$. Therefore $g_{1}^{-1} g_{1}{ }^{\prime} \in G_{x}$, so $g_{1}{ }^{\prime} \in g_{1} G_{x}$, and $g_{1} G_{x}=g_{1}{ }^{\prime} G_{x}$. Thus the map $\psi$ is well defined.

To show the map $\psi$ is one to one, suppose $x_{1}, x_{2} \in G x$, and $\psi\left(x_{1}\right)=\psi\left(x_{2}\right)$. Then there exist $g_{1}, g_{2} \in G$ such that $x_{1}=g_{1} x, x_{2}=g_{2} x$, and $g_{2} \in g_{1} G_{x}$. Then $g_{2}=g_{1} g$ for some $g \in G_{x}$, so $x_{2}=g_{2} x=g_{1}(g x)=g_{1} x=x_{1}$. Thus $\psi$ is one to one.

Finally, we show that each left coset of $G_{x}$ in $G$ is of the form $\psi\left(x_{1}\right)$ for some $x_{1} \in G x$. Let $g_{1} G_{x}$ be a left coset. Then if $g_{1} x=x_{1}$, we have $g_{1} G_{x}=\psi\left(x_{1}\right)$. Thus $\psi$ maps $G x$ one to one onto the collection of left cosets so $|G x|=\left(G: G_{x}\right)$.

If $|G|$ is finite, then the equation $|G|=\left|G_{x}\right|\left(G: G_{x}\right)$ shows that $|G x|=\left(G: G_{x}\right)$ is a divisor of $|G|$.

16.17 Example Let $X$ be the $D_{4}$-set in Example 16.8, with action table given by Table 16.10. With $G=D_{4}$, we have $G 1=\{1,2,3,4\}$ and $G_{1}=\left\{\rho_{0}, \delta_{2}\right\}$. Since $|G|=8$, we have $|G 1|=$ $\left(G: G_{1}\right)=4$.

We should remember not only the cardinality equation in Theorem 16.16 but also that the elements of $G$ carrying $x$ into $g_{1} x$ are precisely the elements of the left coset $g_{1} G_{x}$. Namely, if $g \in G_{x}$, then $\left(g_{1} g\right) x=g_{1}(g x)=g_{1} x$. On the other hand, if $g_{2} x=g_{1} x$, then $g_{1}^{-1}\left(g_{2} x\right)=x$ so $\left(g_{1}^{-1} g_{2}\right) x=x$. Thus $g_{1}^{-1} g_{2} \in G_{x}$ so $g_{2} \in g_{1} G_{x}$.

[Hint: For $x \in X$, suppose $x=g x_{0}$, and define $\phi: X \rightarrow L$ by $\phi(x)=g G_{x_{0}}$. Be sure to show $\phi$ is well defined!]
16. Let $X_{i}$ for $i \in I$ be $G$-sets for the same group $G$, and suppose the sets $X_{i}$ are not necessarily disjoint. Let $X_{i}^{\prime}=\left\{(x, i) \mid x \in X_{i}\right\}$ for each $i \in I$. Then the sets $X_{i}^{\prime}$ are disjoint, and each can still be regarded as a $G$-set in an obvious way. (The elements of $X_{i}$ have simply been tagged by $i$ to distinguish them from the elements of $X_{j}$ for $i \neq j$.) The $G$-set $\bigcup_{i \in I} X_{i}^{\prime}$ is the disjoint union of the $G$-sets $X_{i}$. Using Exercises 14 and 15, show that every $G$-set is isomorphic to a disjoint union of left coset $G$-sets, as described in Example 16.7.
17. The preceding exercises show that every $G$-set $X$ is isomorphic to a disjoint union of left coset $G$-sets. The question then arises whether left coset $G$-sets of distinct subgroups $H$ and $K$ of $G$ can themselves be isomorphic. Note that the map defined in the hint of Exercise 15 depends on the choice of $x_{0}$ as "base point." If $x_{0}$ is replaced by $g_{0} x_{0}$ and if $G_{x_{0}} \neq G_{g_{0} x_{0}}$, then the collections $L_{H}$ of left cosets of $H=G_{x_{0}}$ and $L_{K}$ of left cosets of $K=G_{g_{0} x_{0}}$ form distinct $G$-sets that must be isomorphic, since both $L_{H}$ and $L_{K}$ are isomorphic to $X$.

a. Let $X$ be a transitive $G$-set and let $x_{0} \in X$ and $g_{0} \in G$. If $H=G_{x_{0}}$, describe $K=G_{g_{0} x_{0}}$ in terms of $H$ and $g_{0}$.

b. Based on part (a), conjecture conditions on subgroups $H$ and $K$ of $G$ such that the left coset $G$-sets of $H$ and $K$ are isomorphic.

c. Prove your conjecture in part (b).

18. Up to isomorphism, how many transitive $\mathbb{Z}_{4}$-sets $X$ are there? (Use the preceding exercises.) Give an example of each isomorphism type, listing an action table of each as in Table 16.10. Take lowercase names $a, b, c$, and so on for the elements in the set $X$.
19. Repeat Exercise 18 for the group $\mathbb{Z}_{6}$.
20. Repeat Exercise 18 for the group $S_{3}$. List the elements of $S_{3}$ in the order $\iota,(1,2,3),(1,3,2),(2,3),(1,3)$, $(1,2)$.

## SECTION 17 †Applications OF $G$-Sets to Counting

This section presents an application of our work with $G$-sets to counting. Suppose, for example, we wish to count how many distinguishable ways the six faces of a cube can be marked with from one to six dots to form a die. The standard die is marked so that when placed on a table with the 1 on the bottom and the 2 toward the front, the 6 is on top, the 3 on the left, the 4 on the right, and the 5 on the back. Of course, other ways of marking the cube to give a distinguishably different die are possible.

Let us distinguish between the faces of the cube for the moment and call them the bottom, top, left, right, front, and back. Then the bottom can have any one of six marks from one dot to six dots, the top any one of the five remaining marks, and so on. There are $6 !=720$ ways the cube faces can be marked in all. Some markings yield the same die as others, in the sense that one marking can be carried into another by a rotation of the marked cube. For example, if the standard die described above is rotated $90^{\circ}$ counterclockwise as we look down on it, then 3 will be on the front face rather than 2 , but it is the same die.

There are 24 possible positions of a cube on a table, for any one of six faces can be placed down, and then any one of four to the front, giving $6 \cdot 4=24$ possible positions. Any position can be achieved from any other by a rotation of the die. These rotations form a group $G$, which is isomorphic to a subgroup of $S_{8}$ (see Exercise 45 of Section 8). We let $X$ be the 720 possible ways of marking the cube and let $G$ act on $X$ by rotation of the cube. We consider two markings to give the same die if one can be carried into the other under action by an element of $G$, that is, by rotating the cube. In other words, we consider each orbit in $X$ under $G$ to correspond to a single die, and different orbits to give different dice. The determination of the number of distinguishable dice thus leads to the question of determining the number of orbits under $G$ in a $G$-set $X$.

The following theorem gives a tool for determining the number of orbits in a $G$ set $X$ under $G$. Recall that for each $g \in G$ we let $X_{g}$ be the set of elements of $X$ left fixed by $g$, so that $X_{g}=\{x \in X \mid g x=x\}$. Recall also that for each $x \in X$, we let $G_{x}=\{g \in G \mid g x=x\}$, and $G x$ is the orbit of $x$ under $G$.

17.1 Theorem (Burnside's Formula) Let $G$ be a finite group and $X$ a finite $G$-set. If $r$ is the number of orbits in $X$ under $G$, then

$$
r \cdot|G|=\sum_{g \in G}\left|X_{g}\right|
$$[^10]

Proof We consider all pairs $(g, x)$ where $g x=x$, and let $N$ be the number of such pairs. For each $g \in G$ there are $\left|X_{g}\right|$ pairs having $g$ as first member. Thus,

$$
N=\sum_{g \in G}\left|X_{g}\right|
$$

On the other hand, for each $x \in X$ there are $\left|G_{x}\right|$ pairs having $x$ as second member. Thus we also have

$$
N=\sum_{x \in X}\left|G_{x}\right|
$$

By Theorem 16.16 we have $|G x|=\left(G: G_{x}\right)$. But we know that $\left(G: G_{x}\right)=|G| /\left|G_{x}\right|$, so we obtain $\left|G_{x}\right|=|G| /|G x|$. Then

$$
N=\sum_{x \in X} \frac{|G|}{|G x|}=|G|\left(\sum_{x \in X} \frac{1}{|G x|}\right)
$$

Now $1 /|G x|$ has the same value for all $x$ in the same orbit, and if we let $\mathcal{O}$ be any orbit, then

$$
\sum_{x \in \mathcal{O}} \frac{1}{|G x|}=\sum_{x \in \mathcal{O}} \frac{1}{|\mathcal{O}|}=1
$$

Substituting (4) in (3), we obtain

$$
N=|G|(\text { number of orbits in } X \text { under } G)=|G| \cdot r \text {. }
$$

Comparison of Eq. 2 and Eq. 5 gives Eq. 1.

17.2 Corollary If $G$ is a finite group and $X$ is a finite $G$-set, then

$$
\text { (number of orbits in } X \text { under } G \text { ) }=\frac{1}{|G|} \cdot \sum_{g \in G}\left|X_{g}\right| \text {. }
$$

Proof The proof of this corollary follows immediately from the preceding theorem.

Let us continue our computation of the number of distinguishable dice as our first example.

17.3 Example We let $X$ be the set of 720 different markings of faces of a cube using from one to six dots. Let $G$ be the group of 24 rotations of the cube as discussed above. We saw that the number of distinguishable dice is the number of orbits in $X$ under $G$. Now $|G|=24$. For $g \in G$ where $g \neq e$, we have $\left|X_{g}\right|=0$, because any rotation other than the identity element changes any one of the 720 markings into a different one. However, $\left|X_{e}\right|=720$ since the identity element leaves all 720 markings fixed. Then by Corollary 17.2,

$$
(\text { number of orbits })=\frac{1}{24} \cdot 720=30,
$$

so there are 30 distinguishable dice.

Of course the number of distinguishable dice could be counted without using the machinery of the preceding corollary, but by using elementary combinatorics as often taught in a freshman finite math course. In marking a cube to make a die, we can, by rotation if necessary, assume the face marked 1 is down. There are five choices for the top (opposite) face. By rotating the die as we look down on it, any one of the remaining four faces could be brought to the front position, so there are no different choices involved for the front face. But with respect to the number on the front face, there are $3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1$ possibilities for the remaining three side faces. Thus there are $5 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1=30$ possibilities in all.

The next two examples appear in some finite math texts and are easy to solve by elementary means. We use Corollary 17.2 so that we have more practice thinking in terms of orbits.

17.4 Example How many distinguishable ways can seven people be seated at a round table, where there is no distinguishable "head" to the table? Of course there are 7! ways to assign people to the different chairs. We take $X$ to be the 7 ! possible assignments. A rotation of people achieved by asking each person to move one place to the right results in the same arrangement. Such a rotation generates a cyclic group $G$ of order 7 , which we consider to act on $X$ in the obvious way. Again, only the identity $e$ leaves any arrangement fixed, and it leaves all 7 ! arrangements fixed. By Corollary 17.2

$$
(\text { number of orbits })=\frac{1}{7} \cdot 7 !=6 !=720 .
$$

17.5 Example How many distinguishable necklaces (with no clasp) can be made using seven differentcolored beads of the same size? Unlike the table in Example 17.4, the necklace can be turned over as well as rotated. Thus we consider the full dihedral group $D_{7}$ of order $2 \cdot 7=14$ as acting on the set $X$ of 7 ! possibilities. Then the number of distinguishable necklaces is

$$
\text { (number of orbits) }=\frac{1}{14} \cdot 7 !=360
$$

In using Corollary 17.2, we have to compute $|G|$ and $\left|X_{g}\right|$ for each $g \in G$. In the examples and the exercises, $|G|$ will pose no real problem. Let us give an example where $\left|X_{g}\right|$ is not as trivial to compute as in the preceding examples. We will continue to assume knowledge of very elementary combinatorics.

17.6 Example Let us find the number of distinguishable ways the edges of an equilateral triangle can be painted if four different colors of paint are available, assuming only one color is used on each edge, and the same color may be used on different edges.

Of course there are $4^{3}=64$ ways of painting the edges in all, since each of the three edges may be any one of four colors. We consider $X$ to be the set of these 64 possible painted triangles. The group $G$ acting on $X$ is the group of symmetries of the triangle, which is isomorphic to $S_{3}$ and which we consider to be $S_{3}$. We use the notation for
elements in $S_{3}$ given in Section 8. We need to compute $\left|X_{g}\right|$ for each of the six elements $g$ in $S_{3}$.

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
\left|X_{\rho_{0}}\right|=64 & \text { Every painted triangle is left fixed by } \rho_{0} . \\
\left|X_{\rho_{1}}\right|=4 & \text { To be invariant under } \rho_{1} \text {, all edges must be the } \\
\left|X_{\rho_{2}}\right|=4 & \text { same color, and there are } 4 \text { possible colors. } \\
\left|X_{\mu_{1}}\right|=16 & \text { Same reason as for } \rho_{1} . \\
\left|X_{\mu_{2}}\right|=\left|X_{\mu_{3}}\right|=16 & \begin{array}{l}
\text { The edges that are interchanged must be the same } \\
\text { color (4 possibilities) and the other edge may } \\
\text { also be any of the colors (times 4 possibilities). }
\end{array} \\
\text { Same reason as for } \mu_{1} .
\end{array}
$$

Then

$$
\sum_{g \in S_{3}}\left|X_{g}\right|=64+4+4+16+16+16=120
$$

Thus

$$
(\text { number of orbits })=\frac{1}{6} \cdot 120=20
$$

and there are 20 distinguishable painted triangles.

17.7 Example We repeat Example 17.6 with the assumption that a different color is used on each edge. The number of possible ways of painting the edges is then $4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2=24$, and we let $X$ be the set of 24 possible painted triangles. Again, the group acting on $X$ can be considered to be $S_{3}$. Since all edges are a different color, we see $\left|X_{\rho_{0}}\right|=24$ while $\left|X_{g}\right|=0$ for $g \neq \rho_{0}$. Thus

$$
\text { (number of orbits) }=\frac{1}{6} \cdot 24=4,
$$

so there are four distinguishable triangles.

## EXERCISES 17

## Computations

In each of the following exercises use Corollary 17.2 to work the problem, even though the answer might be obtained by more elementary methods.

## SECTION 18 RingS AND FiELDS

All our work thus far has been concerned with sets on which a single binary operation has been defined. Our years of work with the integers and real numbers show that a study of sets on which two binary operations have been defined should be of great importance. Algebraic structures of this type are introduced in this section. In one sense, this section seems more intutive than those that precede it, for the structures studied are closely related to those we have worked with for many years. However, we will be continuing with our axiomatic approach. So, from another viewpoint this study is more complicated than group theory, for we now have two binary operations and more axioms to deal with.

## Definitions and Basic Properties

The most general algebraic structure with two binary operations that we shall study is called a ring. As Example 18.2 following Definition 18.1 indicates, we have all worked with rings since grade school.

18.1 Definition A ring $\langle R,+, \cdot\rangle$ is a set $R$ together with two binary operations + and $\cdot$, which we call addition and multiplication, defined on $R$ such that the following axioms are satisfied:

$\mathscr{R}_{1} \cdot\langle R,+\rangle$ is an abelian group.

$\mathscr{R}_{2}$. Multiplication is associative.

$\mathscr{R}_{3}$. For all $a, b, c \in R$, the left distributive law, $a \cdot(b+c)=(a \cdot b)+(a \cdot c)$ and the right distributive law $(a+b) \cdot c=(a \cdot c)+(b \cdot c)$ hold.[^11]

18.2 Example We are well aware that axioms $\mathscr{R}_{1}, \mathscr{R}_{2}$, and $\mathscr{R}_{3}$ for a ring hold in any subset of the complex numbers that is a group under addition and that is closed under multiplication. For example, $\langle\mathbb{Z},+, \cdot\rangle,\langle\mathbb{Q},+, \cdot\rangle,\langle\mathbb{R},+, \cdot\rangle$, and $\langle\mathbb{C},+, \cdot\rangle$ are rings.

## Historical Note

$\mathrm{T}$ The theory of rings grew out of the study of two particular classes of rings, polynomial rings in $n$ variables over the real or complex numbers (Section 22) and the "integers" of an algebraic number field. It was David Hilbert (1862-1943) who first introduced the term ring, in connection with the latter example, but it was not until the second decade of the twentieth century that a fully abstract definition appeared. The theory of commutative rings was given a firm axiomatic foundation by Emmy Noether (1882-1935) in her monumental paper "Ideal Theory in Rings," which appeared in 1921. A major concept of this paper is the ascending chain condition for ideals. Noether proved that in any ring in which every ascending chain of ideals has a maximal element, every ideal is finitely generated.

Emmy Noether received her doctorate from the University of Erlangen, Germany, in 1907. Hilbert invited her to Göttingen in 1915, but his efforts to secure her a paid position were blocked because of her sex. Hilbert complained, "I do not see that the sex of the candidate is an argument against her admission [to the faculty]. After all, we are a university, not a bathing establishment." Noether was, however, able to lecture under Hilbert's name. Ultimately, after the political changes accompanying the end of the First World War reached Göttingen, she was given in 1923 a paid position at the University. For the next decade, she was very influential in the development of the basic concepts of modern algebra. Along with other Jewish faculty members, however, she was forced to leave Göttingen in 1933. She spent the final two years of her life at Bryn Mawr College near Philadelphia.

It is customary to denote multiplication in a ring by juxtaposition, using $a b$ in place of $a \cdot b$. We shall also observe the usual convention that multiplication is performed before addition in the absence of parentheses, so the left distributive law, for example, becomes

$$
a(b+c)=a b+a c
$$

without the parentheses on the right side of the equation. Also, as a convenience analogous to our notation in group theory, we shall somewhat incorrectly refer to a ring $R$ in place of a ring $\langle R,+, \cdot\rangle$, provided that no confusion will result. In particular, from now on $\mathbb{Z}$ will always be $\langle\mathbb{Z},+, \cdot\rangle$, and $\mathbb{Q}, \mathbb{R}$, and $\mathbb{C}$ will also be the rings in Example 18.2. We may on occasion refer to $\langle R,+\rangle$ as the additive group of the ring $R$.

18.3 Example Let $R$ be any ring and let $M_{n}(R)$ be the collection of all $n \times n$ matrices having elements of $R$ as entries. The operations of addition and multiplication in $R$ allow us to add and multiply matrices in the usual fashion, explained in the appendix. We can quickly check that $\left\langle M_{n}(R),+\right\rangle$ is an abelian group. The associativity of matrix multiplication and the two distributive laws in $M_{n}(R)$ are more tedious to demonstrate, but straightforward calculations indicate that they follow from the same properties in $R$. We will
assume from now on that we know that $M_{n}(R)$ is a ring. In particular, we have the rings $M_{n}(\mathbb{Z}), M_{n}(\mathbb{Q}), M_{n}(\mathbb{R})$, and $M_{n}(\mathbb{C})$. Note that multiplication is not a commutative operation in any of these rings for $n \geq 2$.

18.4 Example Let $F$ be the set of all functions $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. We know that $\langle F,+\rangle$ is an abelian group under the usual function addition,

$$
(f+g)(x)=f(x)+g(x) .
$$

We define multiplication on $F$ by

$$
(f g)(x)=f(x) g(x)
$$

That is, $f g$ is the function whose value at $x$ is $f(x) g(x)$. It is readily checked that $F$ is a ring; we leave the demonstration to Exercise 34. We have used this juxtaposition notation $\sigma \mu$ for the composite function $\sigma(\mu(x))$ when discussing permutation multiplication. If we were to use both function multiplication and function composition in $F$, we would use the notation $f \circ g$ for the composite function. However, we will be using composition of functions almost exclusively with homomorphisms, which we will denote by Greek letters, and the usual product defined in this example chiefly when multiplying polynomial function $f(x) g(x)$, so no confusion should result.

18.5 Example Recall that in group theory, $n \mathbb{Z}$ is the cyclic subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}$ under addition consisting of all integer multiples of the integer $n$. Since $(n r)(n s)=n(n r s)$, we see that $n \mathbb{Z}$, is closed under multiplication. The associative and distributive laws which hold in $\mathbb{Z}$ then assure us that $\langle n \mathbb{Z},+, \cdot\rangle$ is a ring. From now on in the text, we will consider $n \mathbb{Z}$ to be this ring.

18.6 Example Consider the cyclic group $\left\langle\mathbb{Z}_{n},+\right\rangle$. If we define for $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}_{n}$ the product $a b$ as the remainder of the usual product of integers when divided by $n$, it can be shown that $\left\langle\mathbb{Z}_{n},+, \cdot\right\rangle$ is a ring. We shall feel free to use this fact. For example, in $\mathbb{Z}_{10}$ we have $(3)(7)=1$. This operation on $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ is multiplication modulo $n$. We do not check the ring axioms here, for they will follow in Section 26 from some of the theory we develop there. From now on, $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ will always be the ring $\left\langle\mathbb{Z}_{n},+, \cdot\right\rangle$.

18.7 Example If $R_{1}, R_{2}, \cdots, R_{n}$ are rings, we can form the set $R_{1} \times R_{2} \times \cdots \times R_{n}$ of all ordered $n$-tuples $\left(r_{1}, r_{2}, \cdots, r_{n}\right)$, where $r_{i} \in R_{i}$. Defining addition and multiplication of $n$-tuples by components (just as for groups), we see at once from the ring axioms in each component that the set of all these $n$-tuples forms a ring under addition and multiplication by components. The ring $R_{1} \times R_{2} \times \cdots \times R_{n}$ is the direct product of the rings $R_{i}$.

Continuing matters of notation, we shall always let 0 be the additive identity of a ring. The additive inverse of an element $a$ of a ring is $-a$. We shall frequently have occasion to refer to a sum

$$
a+a+\cdots+a
$$

having $n$ summands. We shall let this sum be $n \cdot a$, always using the dot. However, $n \cdot a$ is not to be constructed as a multiplication of $n$ and $a$ in the ring, for the integer $n$ may not be in the ring at all. If $n<0$, we let

$$
n \cdot a=(-a)+(-a)+\cdots+(-a)
$$

for $|n|$ summands. Finally, we define

$$
0 \cdot a=0
$$

for $0 \in \mathbb{Z}$ on the left side of the equations and $0 \in R$ on the right side. Actually, the equation $0 a=0$ holds also for $0 \in R$ on both sides. The following theorem proves this and various other elementary but important facts. Note the strong use of the distributive laws in the proof of this theorem. Axiom $\mathscr{R}_{1}$ for a ring concerns only addition, and axiom $\mathscr{R}_{2}$ concerns only multiplication. This shows that in order to prove anything that gives a relationship between these two operations, we are going to have to use axiom $\mathscr{R}_{3}$. For example, the first thing that we will show in Theorem 18.8 is that $0 a=0$ for any element $a$ in a ring $R$. Now this relation involves both addition and multiplication. The multiplication $0 a$ stares us in the face, and 0 is an additive concept. Thus we will have to come up with an argument that uses a distributive law to prove this.

18.8 Theorem If $R$ is a ring with additive identity 0 , then for any $a, b \in R$ we have

1. $0 a=a 0=0$,
2. $a(-b)=(-a) b=-(a b)$,
3. $(-a)(-b)=a b$.

Proof For Property 1 , note that by axioms $\mathscr{R}_{1}$ and $\mathscr{R}_{2}$,

$$
a 0+a 0=a(0+0)=a 0=0+a 0 .
$$

Then by the cancellation law for the additive group $\langle R,+\rangle$, we have $a 0=0$. Likewise,

$$
0 a+0 a=(0+0) a=0 a=0+0 a
$$

implies that $0 a=0$. This proves Property 1 .

In order to understand the proof of Property 2, we must remember that, by definition, $-(a b)$ is the element that when added to $a b$ gives 0 . Thus to show that $a(-b)=-(a b)$, we must show precisely that $a(-b)+a b=0$. By the left distributive law,

$$
a(-b)+a b=a(-b+b)=a 0=0
$$

since $\mathrm{a} 0=0$ by Property 1 . Likewise,

$$
(-a) b+a b=(-a+a) b=0 b=0 \text {. }
$$

For Property 3, note that

$$
(-a)(-b)=-(a(-b))
$$

by Property 2. Again by Property 2,

$$
-(a(-b))=-(-(a b))
$$

and $-(-(a b))$ is the element that when added to $-(a b)$ gives 0 . This is $a b$ by definition of $-(a b)$ and by the uniqueness of an inverse in a group. Thus, $(-a)(-b)=a b$.

It is important that you understand the preceding proof. The theorem allows us to use our usual rules for signs.

## Homomorphisms and Isomorphisms

From our work in group theory, it is quite clear how a structure-relating map of a ring $R$ into a ring $R^{\prime}$ should be defined.

18.9 Definition For rings $R$ and $R^{\prime}$, a map $\phi: R \rightarrow R^{\prime}$ is a homomorphism if the following two conditions are satisfied for all $a, b \in R$ :

1. $\phi(a+b)=\phi(a)+\phi(b)$,
2. $\phi(a b)=\phi(a) \phi(b)$.

In the preceding definition, Condition 1 is the statement that $\phi$ is a homomorphism mapping the abelian group $\langle R,+\rangle$ into $\left\langle R^{\prime},+\right\rangle$. Condition 2 requires that $\phi$ relate the multiplicative structures of the rings $R$ and $R^{\prime}$ in the same way. Since $\phi$ is also a group homomorphism, all the results concerning group homomorphisms are valid for the additive structure of the rings. In particular, $\phi$ is one to one if and only if its kernel $\operatorname{Ker}(\phi)=\left\{a \in R \mid \phi(a)=0^{\prime}\right\}$ is just the subset $\{0\}$ of $R$. The homomorphism $\phi$ of the group $\langle R,+\rangle$ gives rise to a factor group. We expect that a ring homomorphism will give rise to a factor ring. This is indeed the case. We delay discussion of this to Section 26, where the treatment will parallel our treatment of factor groups in Section 14.

18.10 Example Let $F$ be the ring of all functions mapping $\mathbb{R}$ into $\mathbb{R}$ defined in Example 18.4. For each $a \in \mathbb{R}$, we have the evaluation homomorphism $\phi_{a}: F \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, where $\phi_{a}(f)=f(a)$ for $f \in F$. We defined this homomorphism for the group $\langle F,+\rangle$ in Example 13.4, but we did not do much with it in group theory. We will be working a great deal with it in the rest of this text, for finding a real solution of a polynomial equation $p(x)=0$ amounts precisely to finding $a \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $\phi_{a}(p)=0$. Much of the remainder of this text deals with solving polynomial equations. We leave the demonstration of the multiplicative homomorphism property 2 for $\phi_{a}$ to Exercise 35 .

18.11 Example

The map $\phi: \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_{n}$ where $\phi(a)$ is the remainder of $a$ modulo $n$ is a ring homomorphism for each positive integer $n$. We know $\phi(a+b)=\phi(a)+\phi(b)$ by group theory. To show the multiplicative property, write $a=q_{1} n+r_{1}$ and $b=q_{2} n+r_{2}$ according to the division algorithm. Then $a b=n\left(q_{1} q_{2} n+r_{1} q_{2}+q_{1} r_{2}\right)+r_{1} r_{2}$. Thus $\phi(a b)$ is the remainder of $r_{1} r_{2}$ when divided by $n$. Since $\phi(a)=r_{1}$ and $\phi(b)=r_{2}$, Example 18.6 indicates that $\phi(a) \phi(b)$ is also this same remainder, so $\phi(a b)=\phi(a) \phi(b)$. From group theory, we anticipate that the ring $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ might be isomorphic to a factor ring $\mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z}$. This is indeed the case; factor rings will be discussed in Section 26.

We realize that in the study of any sort of mathematical structure, an idea of basic importance is the concept of two systems being structurally identical, that is, one being just like the other except for names. In algebra this concept is always called isomorphism.

The concept of two things being just alike except for names of elements leads us, just as it did for groups, to the following definition.

18.12 Definition An isomorphism $\phi: R \rightarrow R^{\prime}$ from a ring $R$ to a ring $R^{\prime}$ is a homomorphism that is one to one and onto $R^{\prime}$. The rings $R$ and $R^{\prime}$ are then isomorphic.

From our work in group theory, we expect that isomorphism gives an equivalence relation on any collection of rings. We need to check that the multiplicative property of an isomorphism is satisfied for the inverse map $\phi^{-1}: R^{\prime} \rightarrow R$ (to complete the symmetry argument). Similarly, we check that if $\mu: R^{\prime} \rightarrow R^{\prime \prime}$ is also a ring ismorphism, then the multiplicative requirement holds for the composite map $\mu \phi: R \rightarrow R^{\prime \prime}$ (to complete the transitivity argument). We ask you to do this in Exercise 36.

18.13 Example

As abelian groups, $\langle\mathbb{Z},+\rangle$ and $\langle 2 \mathbb{Z},+\rangle$ are isomorphic under the map $\phi: \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$, with $\phi(x)=2 x$ for $x \in \mathbb{Z}$. Here $\phi$ is not a ring isomorphism, for $\phi(x y)=2 x y$, while $\phi(x) \phi(y)=2 x 2 y=4 x y$.

## Multiplicative Questions: Fields

Many of the rings we have mentioned, such as $\mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{Q}$, and $\mathbb{R}$, have a multiplicative identity element 1 . However, $2 \mathbb{Z}$ does not have an identity element for multiplication. Note also that multiplication is not commutative in the matrix rings described in Example 18.3.

It is evident that $\{0\}$, with $0+0=0$ and $(0)(0)=0$, gives a ring, the zero ring. Here 0 acts as multiplicative as well as additive identity element. By Theorem 18.8, this is the only case in which 0 could act as a multiplicative identity element, for from $0 a=0$, we can then deduce that $a=0$. Theorem 3.13 shows that if a ring has a multiplicative identity element, it is unique. We denote a multiplicative identity element in a ring by 1 .

18.14 Definition A ring in which the multiplication is commutative is a commutative ring. A ring with a multiplicative identity element is a ring with unity; the multiplicative identity element 1 is called "unity."

In a ring with unity 1 the distributive laws show that

$$
\begin{aligned}
& (1+1+\cdots+1)(1+1+\cdots+1)=(1+1+\cdots+1), \\
& n \text { summands } \quad m \text { summands } \quad n m \text { summands }
\end{aligned}
$$

that is, $(n \cdot 1)(m \cdot 1)=(n m) \cdot 1$. The next example gives an application of this observation.

18.15 Example We claim that for integers $r$ and $s$ where $\operatorname{gcd}(r, s)=1$, the rings $\mathbb{Z}_{r s}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_{r} \times \mathbb{Z}_{s}$ are isomorphic. Additively, they are both cyclic abelian groups of order $r s$ with generators 1 and $(1,1)$ respectively. Thus $\phi: \mathbb{Z}_{r s} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_{r} \times \mathbb{Z}_{s}$ defined by $\phi(n \cdot 1)=n \cdot(1,1)$ is an additive group isomorphism. To check the multiplicative Condition 2 of Definition 18.9,
we use the observation preceding this example for the unity $(1,1)$ in the ring $\mathbb{Z}_{r} \times \mathbb{Z}_{s}$, and compute.

$$
\phi(n m)=(n m) \cdot(1,1)=[n \cdot(1,1)][m \cdot(1,1)]=\phi(n) \phi(m) .
$$

Note that a direct product $R_{1} \times R_{2} \times \cdots \times R_{n}$ of rings is commutative or has unity if and only if each $R_{i}$ is commutative or has unity, respectively.

In a ring $R$ with unity $1 \neq 0$, the set $R^{*}$ of nonzero elements, if closed under the ring multiplication, will be a multiplicative group if multiplicative inverses exist. A multiplicative inverse of an element $a$ in a ring $R$ with unity $1 \neq 0$ is an element $a^{-1} \in R$ such that $a a^{-1}=a^{-1} a=1$. Precisely as for groups, a multiplicative inverse for an element $a$ in $R$ is unique, if it exists at all (see Exercise 43). Theorem 18.8 shows that it would be hopeless to have a multiplicative inverse for 0 except for the ring $\{0\}$, where $0+0=0$ and $(0)(0)=0$, with 0 as both additive and multiplicative identity element. We are thus led to discuss the existence of multiplicative inverses for nonzero elements in a ring with nonzero unity. There is unavoidably a lot of terminology to be defined in this introductory section on rings. We are almost done.

18.16 Definition Let $R$ be a ring with unity $1 \neq 0$. An element $u$ in $R$ is a unit of $R$ if it has a multiplicative inverse in $R$. If every nonzero element of $R$ is a unit, then $R$ is a division ring (or skew field). A field is a commutative division ring. A noncommutative division ring is called a "strictly skew field."

18.17 Example Let us find the units in $\mathbb{Z}_{14}$. Of course, 1 and $-1=13$ are units. Since (3)(5) $=1$ we see that 3 and 5 are units; therefore $-3=11$ and $-5=9$ are also units. None of the remaining elements of $\mathbb{Z}_{14}$ can be units, since no multiple of $2,4,6,7,8$, or 10 can be one more than a multiple of 14 ; they all have a common factor, either 2 or 7 , with 14. Section 20 will show that the units in $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ are precisely those $m \in \mathbb{Z}_{n}$ such that $\operatorname{gcd}(m, n)=1$.

18.18 Example

$\mathbb{Z}$ is not a field, because 2 , for example, has no multiplicative inverse, so 2 is not a unit in $\mathbb{Z}$. The only units in $\mathbb{Z}$ are 1 and -1 . However, $\mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathbb{R}$ are fields. An example of a strictly skew field is given in Section 24.

We have the natural concepts of a subring of a ring and subfield of a field. A subring of a ring is a subset of the ring that is a ring under induced operations from the whole ring; a subfield is defined similarly for a subset of a field. In fact, let us say here once and for all that if we have a set, together with a certain specified type of algebraic structure (group, ring, field, integral domain, vector space, and so on), then any subset of this set, together with a natural induced algebraic structure that yields an algebraic structure of the same type, is a substructure. If $K$ and $L$ are both structures, we shall let $K \leq L$ denote that $K$ is a substructure of $L$ and $K<L$ denote that $K \leq L$ but $K \neq L$. Exercise 48 gives criteria for a subset $S$ of a ring $R$ to form a subring of $R$.

Finally, be careful not to confuse our use of the words unit and unity. Unity is the multiplicative identity element, while a unit is any element having a multiplicative inverse. Thus the multiplicative identity element or unity is a unit, but not every unit is unity. For example, -1 is a unit in $\mathbb{Z}$, but -1 is not unity, that is, $-1 \neq 1$.

## Historical Note

$\mathrm{A}^{1}$ lthough fields were implict in the early work on the solvability of equations by Abel and Galois, it was Leopold Kronecker (1823-1891) who in connection with his own work on this subject first published in 1881 a definition of what he called a "domain of rationality": "The domain of rationality $\left(R^{\prime}, R^{\prime \prime}, R^{\prime \prime \prime}, \cdots\right)$ contains $\cdots$ every one of those quantities which are rational functions of the quantities $R^{\prime}, R^{\prime \prime}, R^{\prime \prime \prime}, \cdots$ with integral coefficients." Kronecker, however, who insisted that any mathematical subject must be constructible in finitely many steps, did not view the domain of rationality as a complete entity, but merely as a region in which took place various operations on its elements.

Richard Dedekind (1831-1916), the inventor of the Dedekind cut definition of a real number, considered a field as a completed entity. In 1871, he published the following definition in his supplement to the second edition of Dirichlet's text on number theory: "By a field we mean any system of infinitely many real or complex numbers, which in itself is so closed and complete, that the addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of any two numbers always produces a number of the same system." Both Kronecker and Dedekind had, however, dealt with their varying ideas of this notion as early as the 1850 s in their university lectures.

A more abstract definition of a field, similar to the one in the text, was given by Heinrich Weber (1842-1913) in a paper of 1893. Weber's definition, unlike that of Dedekind, specifically included fields with finitely many elements as well as other fields, such as function fields, which were not subfields of the field of complex numbers.

## SECTION 19 INTEgRal Domains

While a careful treatment of polynomials is not given until Section 22, for purposes of motivation we shall make intuitive use of them in this section.

## Divisors of Zero and Cancellation

One of the most important algebraic properties of our usual number system is that a product of two numbers can only be 0 if at least one of the factors is 0 . We have used this fact many times in solving equations, perhaps without realizing that we were using it. Suppose, for example, we are asked to solve the equation

$$
x^{2}-5 x+6=0 .
$$

The first thing we do is to factor the left side:

$$
x^{2}-5 x+6=(x-2)(x-3) .
$$

Then we conclude that the only possible values for $x$ are 2 and 3 . Why? The reason is that if $x$ is replaced by any number $a$, the product $(a-2)(a-3)$ of the resulting numbers is 0 if and only if either $a-2=0$ or $a-3=0$.

19.1 Example Solve the equation $x^{2}-5 x+6=0$ in $\mathbb{Z}_{12}$.

Solution The factorization $x^{2}-5 x+6=(x-2)(x-3)$ is still valid if we think of $x$ as standing for any number in $\mathbb{Z}_{12}$. But in $\mathbb{Z}_{12}$, not only is $0 a=a 0=0$ for all $a \in \mathbb{Z}_{12}$, but also

$$
\begin{aligned}
(2)(6) & =(6)(2)=(3)(4)=(4)(3)=(3)(8)=(8)(3) \\
& =(4)(6)=(6)(4)=(4)(9)=(9)(4)=(6)(6)=(6)(8) \\
& =(8)(6)=(6)(10)=(10)(6)=(8)(9)=(9)(8)=0 .
\end{aligned}
$$

We find, in fact, that our equation has not only 2 and 3 as solutions, but also 6 and 11, for $(6-2)(6-3)=(4)(3)=0$ and $(11-2)(11-3)=(9)(8)=0$ in $\mathbb{Z}_{12}$.

These ideas are of such importance that we formalize them in a definition.

19.2 Definition If $a$ and $b$ are two nonzero elements of a ring $R$ such that $a b=0$, then $a$ and $b$ are divisors of 0 (or 0 divisors).

Example 19.1 shows that in $\mathbb{Z}_{12}$ the elements 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, and 10 are divisors of 0 . Note that these are exactly the numbers in $\mathbb{Z}_{12}$ that are not relatively prime to 12 , that is, whose gcd with 12 is not 1 . Our next theorem shows that this is an example of a general situation.

19.3 Theorem In the ring $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$, the divisors of 0 are precisely those nonzero elements that are not relatively prime to $n$.

Proof Let $m \in \mathbb{Z}_{n}$, where $m \neq 0$, and let the ged of $m$ and $n$ be $d \neq 1$. Then

$$
m\left(\frac{n}{d}\right)=\left(\frac{m}{d}\right) n
$$

and $(m / d) n$ gives 0 as a multiple of $n$. Thus $m(n / d)=0$ in $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$, while neither $m$ nor $n / d$ is 0 , so $m$ is a divisor of 0 .

On the other hand, suppose $m \in \mathbb{Z}_{n}$ is relatively prime to $n$. If for $s \in \mathbb{Z}_{n}$ we have $m s=0$, then $n$ divides the product $m s$ of $m$ and $s$ as elements in the ring $\mathbb{Z}$. Since $n$ is relatively prime to $m$, boxed Property 1 following Example 6.9 shows that $n$ divides $s$, so $s=0$ in $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$.

19.4 Corollary If $p$ is a prime, then $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ has no divisors of 0 .

Proof This corollary is immediate from Theorem 19.3.

Another indication of the importance of the concept of 0 divisors is shown in the following theorem. Let $R$ be a ring, and let $a, b, c \in R$. The cancellation laws hold in $R$ if $a b=a c$ with $a \neq 0$ implies $b=c$, and $b a=c a$ with $a \neq 0$ implies $b=c$. These
are multiplicative cancellation laws. Of course, the additive cancellation laws hold in $R$, since $\langle R,+\rangle$ is a group.

19.5 Theorem The cancellation laws hold in a ring $R$ if and only if $R$ has no divisors of 0 .

Proof Let $R$ be a ring in which the cancellation laws hold, and suppose $a b=0$ for some $a, b \in R$. We must show that either $a$ or $b$ is 0 . If $a \neq 0$, then $a b=a 0$ implies that $b=0$ by cancellation laws. Similarly, $b \neq 0$ implies that $a=0$, so there can be no divisors of 0 if the cancellation laws hold.

Conversely, suppose that $R$ has no divisors of 0 , and suppose that $a b=a c$ with $a \neq 0$. Then

$$
a b-a c=a(b-c)=0 .
$$

Since $a \neq 0$, and since $R$ has no divisors of 0 , we must have $b-c=0$, so $b=c$. A similar argument shows that $b a=c a$ with $a \neq 0$ implies $b=c$.

Suppose that $R$ is a ring with no divisors of 0 . Then an equation $a x=b$, with $a \neq 0$, in $R$ can have at most one solution $x$ in $R$, for if $a x_{1}=b$ and $a x_{2}=b$, then $a x_{1}=a x_{2}$, and by Theorem $19.5 x_{1}=x_{2}$, since $R$ has no divisors of 0 . If $R$ has unity $1 \neq 0$ and $a$ is a unit in $R$ with multiplicative inverse $a^{-1}$, then the solution $x$ of $a x=b$ is $a^{-1} b$. In the case that $R$ is commutative, in particular if $R$ is a field, it is customary to denote $a^{-1} b$ and $b a^{-1}$ (they are equal by commutativity) by the formal quotient $b / a$. This quotient notation must not be used in the event that $R$ is not commutative, for then we do not know whether $b / a$ denotes $a^{-1} b$ or $b a^{-1}$. In particular, the multiplicative inverse $a^{-1}$ of a nonzero element $a$ of a field may be written $1 / a$.

## Integral Domains

The integers are really our most familiar number system. In terms of the algebraic properties we are discussing, $\mathbb{Z}$ is a commutative ring with unity and no divisors of 0 . Surely this is responsible for the name that the next definition gives to such a structure.

19.6 Definition An integral domain $D$ is a commutative ring with unity $1 \neq 0$ and containing no divisors of 0 .

Thus, if the coefficients of a polynomial are from an integral domain, one can solve a polynomial equation in which the polynomial can be factored into linear factors in the usual fashion by setting each factor equal to 0.

In our hierarchy of algebraic structures, an integral domain belongs between a commutative ring with unity and a field, as we shall show. Theorem 19.5 shows that the cancellation laws for multiplication hold in an integral domain.

19.7 Example We have seen that $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ for any prime $p$ are integral domains, but $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ is not an integral domain if $n$ is not prime. A moment of thought shows that the direct product $R \times S$ of two nonzero rings $R$ and $S$ is not an integral domain. Just observe that for $r \in R$ and $s \in S$ both nonzero, we have $(r, 0)(0, s)=(0,0)$.

19.8 Example Show that although $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ is an integral domain, the matrix ring $M_{2}\left(\mathbb{Z}_{2}\right)$ has divisors of zero.

Solution We need only observe that

$$
\left(\begin{array}{ll}
1 & 0 \\
0 & 0
\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{ll}
0 & 0 \\
1 & 0
\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{ll}
0 & 0 \\
0 & 0
\end{array}\right)
$$

Our next theorem shows that the structure of a field is still the most restrictive (that is, the richest) one we have defined.

19.9 Theorem Every field $F$ is an integral domain.

Proof Let $a, b \in F$, and suppose that $a \neq 0$. Then if $a b=0$, we have

$$
\left(\frac{1}{a}\right)(a b)=\left(\frac{1}{a}\right) 0=0 .
$$

But then

$$
0=\left(\frac{1}{a}\right)(a b)=\left[\left(\frac{1}{a}\right) a\right] b=1 b=b
$$

We have shown that $a b=0$ with $a \neq 0$ implies that $b=0$ in $F$, so there are no divisors of 0 in $F$. Of course, $F$ is a commutative ring with unity, so our theorem is proved.

Figure 19.10 gives a Venn diagram view of containment for the algebraic structures having two binary operations with which we will be chiefly concerned. In Exercise 20 we ask you to redraw this figure to include strictly skew fields as well.

Thus far the only fields we know are $\mathbb{Q}, \mathbb{R}$, and $\mathbb{C}$. The corollary of the next theorem will exhibit some fields of finite order! The proof of this theorem is a personal favorite. It is done by counting. Counting is one of the most powerful techniques in mathematics.

19.11 Theorem Every finite integral domain is a field.

Proof Let

$$
0,1, a_{1}, \cdots, a_{n}
$$

be all the elements of a finite domain $D$. We need to show that for $a \in D$, where $a \neq 0$, there exists $b \in D$ such that $a b=1$. Now consider

$$
a 1, a a_{1}, \cdots, a a_{n}
$$

We claim that all these elements of $D$ are distinct, for $a a_{i}=a a_{j}$ implies that $a_{i}=a_{j}$, by the cancellation laws that hold in an integral domain. Also, since $D$ has no 0 divisors, none of these elements is 0 . Hence by counting, we find that $a 1, a a_{1}, \cdots, a a_{n}$ are elements $1, a_{1}, \cdots, a_{n}$ in some order, so that either $a 1=1$, that is, $a=1$, or $a a_{i}=1$ for some $i$. Thus $a$ has a multiplicative inverse.

19.12 Corollary If $p$ is a prime, then $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ is a field.

Proof This corollary follows immediately from the fact that $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ is an integral domain and from Theorem 19.11.

The preceding corollary shows that when we consider the ring $M_{n}\left(\mathbb{Z}_{p}\right)$, we are talking about a ring of matrices over a field. In the typical undergraduate linear algebra course, only the field properties of the real or complex numbers are used in much of the work. Such notions as matrix reduction to solve linear systems, determinants, Cramer's rule, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and similarity transformations to try to diagonalize a matrix are valid using matrices over any field; they depend only on the arithmetic properties of a field. Considerations of linear algebra involving notions of magnitude, such as least-squares approximate solutions or orthonormal bases, only make sense using fields where we have an idea of magnitude. The relation

$$
\begin{gathered}
p \cdot 1=1+1+\cdots+1=0 \\
p \text { summands }
\end{gathered}
$$

indicates that there can be no very natural notion of magnitude in the field $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$.

## The Characteristic of a Ring

Let $R$ be any ring. We might ask whether there is a positive integer $n$ such that $n \cdot a=0$ for all $a \in R$, where $n \cdot a$ means $a+a+\cdots+a$ for $n$ summands, as explained in Section 18. For example, the integer $m$ has this property for the ring $\mathbb{Z}_{m}$.

If for a ring $R$ a positive integer $n$ exists such that $n \cdot a=0$ for all $a \in R$, then the least such positive integer is the characteristic of the ring $R$. If no such positive integer exists, then $R$ is of characteristic 0 .

We shall be using the concept of a characteristic chiefly for fields. Exercise 29 asks us to show that the characteristic of an integral domain is either 0 or a prime $p$.

19.14 Example The ring $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ is of characteristic $n$, while $\mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{Q}, \mathbb{R}$, and $\mathbb{C}$ all have characteristic 0 .

At first glance, determination of the characteristic of a ring seems to be a tough job, unless the ring is obviously of characteristic 0 . Do we have to examine every element $a$ of the ring in accordance with Definition 19.13? Our final theorem of this section shows that if the ring has unity, it suffices to examine only $a=1$.

19.15 Theorem Let $R$ be a ring with unity. If $n \cdot 1 \neq 0$ for all $n \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}$, then $R$ has characteristic 0 . If $n \cdot 1=0$ for some $n \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}$, then the smallest such integer $n$ is the characteristic of $R$.

Proof If $n \cdot 1 \neq 0$ for all $n \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}$, then surely we cannot have $n \cdot a=0$ for all $a \in R$ for some positive integer $n$, so by Definition 19.13, $R$ has characteristic 0 .

Suppose that $n$ is a positive integer such that $n \cdot 1=0$. Then for any $a \in R$, we have

$$
n \cdot a=a+a+\cdots+a=a(1+1+\cdots+1)=a(n \cdot 1)=a 0=0 .
$$

Our theorem follows directly.

## SECTION 20 Fermat's and Euler's Theorems

## Fermat's Theorem

We know that as additive groups, $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ and $\mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z}$ are naturally isomorphic, with the coset $a+n \mathbb{Z}$ corresponding to $a$ for each $a \in \mathbb{Z}_{n}$. Furthermore, addition of cosets in $\mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z}$ may be performed by choosing any representatives, adding them in $\mathbb{Z}$, and finding the coset of $n \mathbb{Z}$ containing their sum. It is easy to see that $\mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z}$ can be made into a ring by multiplying cosets in the same fashion, that is, by multiplying any chosen representatives. While we will be showing this later in a more general situation, we do this special case now. We need only show that such coset multiplication is well defined, because the associativity of multiplication and the distributive laws will follow immediately from those properties of the chosen representatives in $\mathbb{Z}$. To this end, choose representatives $a+r n$ and $b+s n$, rather than $a$ and $b$, from the cosets $a+n \mathbb{Z}$ and $b+n \mathbb{Z}$. Then

$$
(a+r n)(b+s n)=a b+(a s+r b+r s n) n,
$$

which is also an element of $a b+n \mathbb{Z}$. Thus the multiplication is well-defined, and our cosets form a ring isomorphic to the ring $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$.

The following is a special case of Exercise 37 in Section 18.

For any field, the nonzero elements form a group under the field multiplication.

In particular, for $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$, the elements

$$
1,2,3, \cdots, p-1
$$

form a group of order $p-1$ under multiplication modulo $p$. Since the order of any element in a group divides the order of the group, we see that for $b \neq 0$ and $b \in \mathbb{Z}_{p}$, we have $b^{p-1}=1$ in $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$. Using the fact that $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ is isomorphic to the ring of cosets of the form $a+p \mathbb{Z}$ described above, we see at once that for any $a \in \mathbb{Z}$ not in the $\operatorname{coset} 0+p \mathbb{Z}$, we must have

$$
a^{p-1} \equiv 1(\bmod p) .
$$

This gives us at once the so-called Little Theorem of Fermat.

20.1 Theorem (Little Theorem of Fermat) If $a \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $p$ is a prime not dividing $a$, then $p$ divides $a^{p-1}-1$, that is, $a^{p-1} \equiv 1(\bmod p)$ for $a \neq 0(\bmod p)$.

20.2 Corollary If $a \in \mathbb{Z}$, then $a^{p} \equiv a(\bmod p)$ for any prime $p$.

Proof The corollary follows from Theorem 20.1 if $a \not \equiv 0(\bmod p)$. If $a \equiv 0(\bmod p)$, then both sides reduce to 0 modulo $p$.

## Historical Note

$\mathrm{T}$ he statement of Theorem 20.1 occurs in a letter from Pierre de Fermat (1601-1665) to Bernard Frenicle de Bessy, dated 18 October 1640. Fermat's version of the theorem was that for any prime $p$ and any geometric progression $a, a^{2}, \cdots, a^{t}, \cdots$, there is a least number $a^{T}$ of the progression such that $p$ divides $a^{T}-1$. Furthermore, $T$ divides $p-1$ and $p$ also divides all numbers of the form $a^{K T}-1$. (It is curious that Fermat failed to note the condition that $p$ not divide $a$; perhaps he felt that it was obvious that the result fails in that case.)

Fermat did not in the letter or elsewhere indicate a proof of the result and, in fact, never mentioned it again. But we can infer from other parts of this correspondence that Fermat's interest in this result came from his study of perfect numbers. (A perfect number is a positive integer $m$ that is the sum of all of its divisors less than $m$; for example, $6=1+2+3$ is a perfect number.) Euclid had shown that $2^{n-1}\left(2^{n}-1\right)$ is perfect if $2^{n}-1$ is prime. The question then was to find methods for determining whether $2^{n}-1$ was prime. Fermat noted that $2^{n}-1$ was composite if $n$ is composite, and then derived from his theorem the result that if $n$ is prime, the only possible divisors of $2^{n}-1$ are those of the form $2 k n+1$. From this result he was able quickly to show, for example, that $2^{37}-1$ was divisible by $223=2 \cdot 3 \cdot 37+1$.

20.3 Example Let us compute the remainder of $8^{103}$ when divided by 13. Using Fermat's theorem, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
8^{103} & \equiv\left(8^{12}\right)^{8}\left(8^{7}\right) \equiv\left(1^{8}\right)\left(8^{7}\right) \equiv 8^{7} \equiv(-5)^{7} \\
& \equiv(25)^{3}(-5) \equiv(-1)^{3}(-5) \equiv 5(\bmod 13)
\end{aligned}
$$

20.4 Example Show that $2^{11,213}-1$ is not divisible by 11 .

Solution By Fermat's theorem, $2^{10} \equiv 1(\bmod 11)$, so

$$
\begin{aligned}
2^{11,213}-1 & \equiv\left[\left(2^{10}\right)^{1,121} \cdot 2^{3}\right]-1 \equiv\left[1^{1,121} \cdot 2^{3}\right]-1 \\
& \equiv 2^{3}-1 \equiv 8-1 \equiv 7(\bmod 11) .
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus the remainder of $2^{11,213}-1$ when divided by 11 is 7 , not 0 . (The number 11,213 is prime, and it has been shown that $2^{11,213}-1$ is a prime number. Primes of the form $2^{p}-1$ where $p$ is prime are known as Mersenne primes.)

20.5 Example Show that for every integer $n$, the number $n^{33}-n$ is divisible by 15 .

Solution This seems like an incredible result. It means that 15 divides $2^{33}-2,3^{33}-3,4^{33}-4$, etc.

Now $15=3 \cdot 5$, and we shall use Fermat's theorem to show that $n^{33}-n$ is divisible by both 3 and 5 for every $n$. Note that $n^{33}-n=n\left(n^{32}-1\right)$.

If 3 divides $n$, then surely 3 divides $n\left(n^{32}-1\right)$. If 3 does not divide $n$, then by Fermat's theorem, $n^{2} \equiv 1(\bmod 3)$ so

$$
n^{32}-1 \equiv\left(n^{2}\right)^{16}-1 \equiv 1^{16}-1 \equiv 0(\bmod 3)
$$

and hence 3 divides $n^{32}-1$.

If $n \equiv 0(\bmod 5)$, then $n^{33}-n \equiv 0(\bmod 5)$. If $n \not \equiv 0(\bmod 5)$, then by Fermat's theorem, $n^{4} \equiv 1(\bmod 5)$, so

$$
n^{32}-1 \equiv\left(n^{4}\right)^{8}-1 \equiv 1^{8}-1 \equiv 0(\bmod 5) .
$$

Thus $n^{33}-n \equiv 0(\bmod 5)$ for every $n$ also.

## Euler's Generalization

Euler gave a generalization of Fermat's theorem. His generalization will follow at once from our next theorem, which is proved by counting, using essentially the same argument as in Theorem 19.11.

20.6 Theorem The set $G_{n}$ of nonzero elements of $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ that are not 0 divisors forms a group under multiplication modulo $n$.

Proof First we must show that $G_{n}$ is closed under multiplication modulo $n$. Let $a, b \in G_{n}$. If $a b \notin G_{n}$, then there would exist $c \neq 0$ in $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ such that $(a b) c=0$. Now $(a b) c=0$ implies that $a(b c)=0$. Since $b \in G_{n}$ and $c \neq 0$, we have $b c \neq 0$ by definition of $G_{n}$. But then $a(b c)=0$ would imply that $a \notin G_{n}$ contrary to assumption. Note that we have shown that for any ring the set of elements that are not divisors of 0 is closed under multiplication. No structure of $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ other than ring structure has been involved so far.

We now show that $G_{n}$ is a group. Of course, multiplication modulo $n$ is associative, and $1 \in G_{n}$. It remains to show that for $a \in G_{n}$, there is $b \in G_{n}$ such that $a b=1$. Let

$$
1, a_{1}, \cdots, a_{r}
$$

be the elements of $G_{n}$. The elements

$$
a 1, a a_{1}, \cdots, a a_{r}
$$

are all different, for if $a a_{i}=a a_{j}$, then $a\left(a_{i}-a_{j}\right)=0$, and since $a \in G_{n}$ and thus is not a divisor of 0 , we must have $a_{i}-a_{j}=0$ or $a_{i}=a_{j}$. Therefore by counting, we find that either $a 1=1$, or some $a a_{i}$ must be 1 , so $a$ has a multiplicative inverse.

Note that the only property of $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ used in this last theorem, other than the fact that it was a ring with unity, was that it was finite. In both Theorem 19.11 and Theorem 20.6 we have (in essentially the same construction) employed a counting argument. Counting arguments are often simple, but they are among the most powerful tools of mathematics.

Let $n$ be a positive integer. Let $\varphi(n)$ be defined as the number of positive integers less than or equal to $n$ and relatively prime to $n$. Note that $\varphi(1)=1$.

20.7 Example Let $n=12$. The positive integers less than or equal to 12 and relatively prime to 12 are $1,5,7$, and 11 , so $\varphi(12)=4$.

By Theorem 19.3, $\varphi(n)$ is the number of nonzero elements of $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ that are not divisors of 0 . This function $\varphi: \mathbb{Z}^{+} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}^{+}$is the Euler phi-function. We can now describe Euler's generalization of Fermat's theorem.

20.8 Theorem (Euler's Theorem) If $a$ is an integer relatively prime to $n$, then $a^{\varphi(n)}-1$ is divisible by $n$, that is, $a^{\varphi(n)} \equiv 1(\bmod n)$.

Proof If $a$ is relatively prime to $n$, then the coset $a+n \mathbb{Z}$ of $n \mathbb{Z}$ containing $a$ contains an integer $b<n$ and relatively prime to $n$. Using the fact that multiplication of these cosets by multiplication modulo $n$ of representatives is well-defined, we have

$$
a^{\varphi(n)} \equiv b^{\varphi(n)}(\bmod n) .
$$

But by Theorems 19.3 and 20.6, $b$ can be viewed as an element of the multiplicative group $G_{n}$ of order $\varphi(n)$ consisting of the $\varphi(n)$ elements of $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ relatively prime to $n$. Thus

$$
b^{\varphi(n)} \equiv 1(\bmod n),
$$

and our theorem follows.

20.9 Example Let $n=12$. We saw in Example 20.7 that $\varphi(12)=4$. Thus if we take any integer $a$ relatively prime to 12 , then $a^{4} \equiv 1(\bmod 12)$. For example, with $a=7$, we have $7^{4}=$ $(49)^{2}=2,401=12(200)+1$, so $7^{4} \equiv 1(\bmod 12)$. Of course, the easy way to compute $7^{4}(\bmod 12)$, without using Euler's theorem, is to compute it in $\mathbb{Z}_{12}$. In $\mathbb{Z}_{12}$, we have $7=-5$ so

$$
7^{2}=(-5)^{2}=(5)^{2}=1 \quad \text { and } \quad 7^{4}=1^{2}=1
$$

## Application to $a x \equiv b(\bmod m)$

Using Theorem 20.6, we can find all solutions of a linear congruence $a x \equiv b(\bmod m)$. We prefer to work with an equation in $\mathbb{Z}_{m}$ and interpret the results for congruences.

20.10 Theorem Let $m$ be a positive integer and let $a \in \mathbb{Z}_{m}$ be relatively prime to $m$. For each $b \in \mathbb{Z}_{m}$, the equation $a x=b$ has a unique solution in $\mathbb{Z}_{m}$.

Proof By Theorem 20.6, $a$ is a unit in $\mathbb{Z}_{m}$ and $s=a^{-1} b$ is certainly a solution of the equation. Multiplying both sides of $a x=b$ on the left by $a^{-1}$, we see this is the only solution.

Interpreting this theorem for congruences, we obtain at once the following corollary.

20.11 Corollary If $a$ and $m$ are relatively prime intergers, then for any integer $b$, the congruence $a x \equiv$ $b(\bmod m)$ has as solutions all integers in precisely one residue class modulo $m$.

Theorem 20.10 serves as a lemma for the general case.

20.12 Theorem Let $m$ be a positive integer and let $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}_{m}$. Let $d$ be the ged of $a$ and $m$. The equation $a x=b$ has a solution in $\mathbb{Z}_{m}$ if and only if $d$ divides $b$. When $d$ divides $b$, the equation has exactly $d$ solutions in $\mathbb{Z}_{m}$.

Proof First we show there is no solution of $a x=b$ in $\mathbb{Z}_{m}$ unless $d$ divides $b$. Suppose $s \in \mathbb{Z}_{m}$ is a solution. Then $a s-b=q m$ in $\mathbb{Z}$, so $b=a s-q m$. Since $d$ divides both $a$ and $m$, we see that $d$ divides the right-hand side of the equation $b=a s-q m$, and hence divides $b$. Thus a solution $s$ can exist only if $d$ divides $b$.

Suppose now that $d$ does divide $b$. Let

$$
a=a_{1} d, \quad b=b_{1} d, \quad \text { and } \quad m=m_{1} d \text {. }
$$

Then the equation $a s-b=q m$ in $\mathbb{Z}$ can be rewritten as $d\left(a_{1} s-b_{1}\right)=d q m_{1}$. We see that $a s-b$ is a multiple of $m$ if and only if $a_{1} s-b_{1}$ is a multiple of $m_{1}$. Thus the solutions $s$ of $a x=b$ in $\mathbb{Z}_{m}$ are precisely the elements that, read modulo $m_{1}$, yield solutions of $a_{1} x=b_{1}$ in $\mathbb{Z}_{m_{1}}$. Now let $s \in \mathbb{Z}_{m_{1}}$ be the unique solution of $a_{1} x=b_{1}$ in $\mathbb{Z}_{m_{1}}$ given by Theorem 20.10. The numbers in $\mathbb{Z}_{m}$ that reduce to $s$ modulo $m_{1}$ are precisely those that can be computed in $\mathbb{Z}_{m}$ as

$$
s, s+m_{1}, s+2 m_{1}, s+3 m_{1}, \cdots, s+(d-1) m_{1} .
$$

Thus there are exactly $d$ solutions of the equation in $\mathbb{Z}_{m}$.

Theorem 20.12 gives us at once this classical result on the solutions of a linear congruence.

20.13 Corollary Let $d$ be the gcd of positive integers $a$ and $m$. The congruence $a x \equiv b(\bmod m)$ has a solution if and only if $d$ divides $b$. When this is the case, the solutions are the integers in exactly $d$ distinct residue classes modulo $m$.

Actually, our proof of Theorem 20.12 shows a bit more about the solutions of $a x \equiv b$ $(\bmod m)$ than we stated in this corollary; namely, it shows that if any solution $s$ is found, then the solutions are precisely all elements of the residue classes $\left(s+k m_{1}\right)+(m \mathbb{Z})$ where $m_{1}=m / d$ and $k$ runs through the integers from 0 to $d-1$. It also tells us that we can find such an $s$ by finding $a_{1}=a / d$ and $b_{1}=b / d$, and solving $a_{1} x \equiv b_{1}\left(\bmod m_{1}\right)$. To solve this congruence, we may consider $a_{1}$ and $b_{1}$ to be replaced by their remainders modulo $m_{1}$ and solve the equation $a_{1} x=b_{1}$ in $\mathbb{Z}_{m_{1}}$.

20.14 Example Find all solutions of the congruence $12 x \equiv 27(\bmod 18)$.

Solution The ged of 12 and 18 is 6 , and 6 is not a divisor of 27 . Thus by the preceding corollary, there are no solutions.

20.15 Example Find all solutions of the congruence $15 x \equiv 27(\bmod 18)$.

Solution The gcd of 15 and 18 is 3, and 3 does divide 27. Proceeding as explained before Example 20.14, we divide everything by 3 and consider the congruence $5 x \equiv 9(\bmod 6)$, which amounts to solving the equation $5 x=3$ in $\mathbb{Z}_{6}$. Now the units in $\mathbb{Z}_{6}$ are 1 and 5 , and 5 is clearly its own inverse in this group of units. Thus the solution in $\mathbb{Z}_{6}$ is $x=\left(5^{-1}\right)(3)=(5)(3)=3$. Consequently, the solutions of $15 x \equiv 27(\bmod 18)$ are the integers in the three residue classes.

$$
\begin{aligned}
3+18 \mathbb{Z} & =\{\cdots,-33,-15,3,21,39, \cdots\} \\
9+18 \mathbb{Z} & =\{\cdots,-27,-9,9,27,45, \cdots\} \\
15+18 \mathbb{Z} & =\{\cdots,-21,-3,15,33,51, \cdots\}
\end{aligned}
$$

illustrating Corollary 20.13. Note the $d=3$ solutions 3,9 , and 15 in $\mathbb{Z}_{18}$. All the solutions in the three displayed residue classes modulo 18 can be collected in the one residue class $3+6 \mathbb{Z}$ modulo 6 , for they came from the solution $x=3$ of $5 x=3$ in $\mathbb{Z}_{6}$.

## Section 21 The Field of Quotients of an Integral Domain

If an integral domain is such that every nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse, then it is a field. However, many integral domains, such as the integers $\mathbb{Z}$, do not form a field. This dilemma is not too serious. It is the purpose of this section to show that every integral domain can be regarded as being contained in a certain field, a field of quotients of the integral domain. This field will be a minimal field containing the integral domain in a sense that we shall describe. For example, the integers are contained in the field $\mathbb{Q}$, whose elements can all be expressed as quotients of integers. Our construction of a field of quotients of an integral domain is exactly the same as the construction of the rational numbers from the integers, which often appears in a course in foundations or advanced calculus. To follow this construction through is such a good exercise in the use of definitions and the concept of isomorphism that we discuss it in some detail, although to write out, or to read, every last detail would be tedious. We can be motivated at every step by the way $\mathbb{Q}$ can be formed from $\mathbb{Z}$.

## The Construction

Let $D$ be an integral domain that we desire to enlarge to a field of quotients $F$. A coarse outline of the steps we take is as follows:

1. Define what the elements of $F$ are to be.
2. Define the binary operations of addition and multiplication on $F$.
3. Check all the field axioms to show that $F$ is a field under these operations.
4. Show that $F$ can be viewed as containing $D$ as an integral subdomain.

Steps 1, 2, and 4 are very interesting, and Step 3 is largely a mechanical chore. We proceed with the construction.

Step 1 Let $D$ be a given integral domain, and form the Cartesian product

$$
D \times D=\{(a, b) \mid a, b \in D\}
$$

We are going to think of an ordered pair $(a, b)$ as representing a formal quotient $a / b$, that is, if $D=\mathbb{Z}$, the pair $(2,3)$ will eventually represent the number $\frac{2}{3}$ for us. The pair $(2,0)$ represents no element of $\mathbb{Q}$ and suggests that we cut the set $D \times D$ down a bit. Let $S$ be the subset of $D \times D$ given by

$$
S=\{(a, b) \mid a, b \in D, b \neq 0\} .
$$

Now $S$ is still not going to be our field as is indicated by the fact that, with $D=\mathbb{Z}$, different pairs of integers such as $(2,3)$ and $(4,6)$ can represent the same rational number. We next define when two elements of $S$ will eventually represent the same element of $F$, or, as we shall say, when two elements of $S$ are equivalent.

21.1 Definition Two elements $(a, b)$ and $(c, d)$ in $S$ are equivalent, denoted by $(a, b) \sim(c, d)$, if and only if $a d=b c$.

Observe that this definition is reasonable, since the criterion for $(a, b) \sim(c, d)$ is an equation $a d=b c$ involving elements in $D$ and concerning the known multiplication in $D$. Note also that for $D=\mathbb{Z}$, the criterion gives us our usual definition of equality of $\frac{a}{b}$ with $\frac{c}{d}$, for example, $\frac{2}{3}=\frac{4}{6}$ since (2)(6) $=(3)(4)$. The rational number that we usually denote by $\frac{2}{3}$ can be thought of as the collection of all quotients of integers that reduce to, or are equivalent to, $\frac{2}{3}$.

21.2 Lemma The relation $\sim$ between elements of the set $S$ as just described is an equivalence relation.

Proof We must check the three properties of an equivalence relation.

Reflexive $(a, b) \sim(a, b)$ since $a b=b a$, for multiplication in $D$ is commutative.

Symmetric If $(a, b) \sim(c, d)$, then $a d=b c$. Since multiplication in $D$ is commutative, we deduce that $c b=d a$, and consequently $(c, d) \sim(a, b)$.

Transitive If $(a, b) \sim(c, d)$ and $(c, d) \sim(r, s)$, then $a d=b c$ and $c s=d r$. Using these relations and the fact that multiplication in $D$ is commutative, we have

$$
a s d=s a d=s b c=b c s=b d r=b r d \text {. }
$$

Now $d \neq 0$, and $D$ is an integral domain, so cancellation is valid; this is a crucial step in the argument. Hence from asd $=b r d$ we obtain $a s=b r$, so that $(a, b) \sim(r, s)$.

We now know, in view of Theorem 0.22, that $\sim$ gives a partition of $S$ into equivalence classes. To avoid long bars over extended expressions, we shall let $[(a, b)]$, rather than $\overline{(a, b)}$, be the equivalence class of $(a, b)$ in $S$ under the relation $\sim$. We now finish Step 1 by defining $F$ to be the set of all equivalence classes $[(a, b)]$ for $(a, b) \in S$.

Step 2 The next lemma serves to define addition and multiplication in $F$. Observe that if $D=\mathbb{Z}$ and $[(a, b)]$ is viewed as $(a / b) \in \mathbb{Q}$, these definitions applied to $\mathbb{Q}$ give the usual operations.

21.3 Lemma For $[(a, b)]$ and $[(c, d)]$ in $F$, the equations

$$
[(a, b)]+[(c, d)]=[(a d+b c, b d)]
$$

and

$$
[(a, b)][(c, d)]=[(a c, b d)]
$$

give well-defined operations of addition and multiplication on $F$.

Proof Observe first that if $[(a, b)]$ and $[(c, d)]$ are in $F$, then $(a, b)$ and $(c, d)$ are in $S$, so $b \neq 0$ and $d \neq 0$. Because $D$ is an integral domain, $b d \neq 0$, so both $(a d+b c, b d)$ and $(a c, b d)$ are in $S$. (Note the crucial use here of the fact that $D$ has no divisors of 0 .) This shows that the right-hand sides of the defining equations are at least in $F$.

It remains for us to show that these operations of addition and multiplication are well defined. That is, they were defined by means of representatives in $S$ of elements of $F$, so we must show that if different representatives in $S$ are chosen, the same element of $F$ will result. To this end, suppose that $\left(a_{1}, b_{1}\right) \in[(a, b)]$ and $\left(c_{1}, d_{1}\right) \in[(c, d)]$. We must show that

$$
\left(a_{1} d_{1}+b_{1} c_{1}, b_{1} d_{1}\right) \in[(a d+b c, b d)]
$$

and

$$
\left(a_{1} c_{1}, b_{1} d_{1}\right) \in[(a c, b d)] .
$$

Now $\left(a_{1}, b_{1}\right) \in[(a, b)]$ means that $\left(a_{1}, b_{1}\right) \sim(a, b)$; that is,

$$
a_{1} b=b_{1} a .
$$

Similarly, $\left(c_{1}, d_{1}\right) \in[(c, d)]$ implies that

$$
c_{1} d=d_{1} c .
$$

To get a "common denominator" (common second member) for the four pairs $(a, b)$, $\left(a_{1}, b_{1}\right),(c, d)$, and $\left(c_{1}, d_{1}\right)$, we multiply the first equation by $d_{1} d$ and the second equation by $b_{1} b$. Adding the resulting equations, we obtain the following equation in $D$ :

$$
a_{1} b d_{1} d+c_{1} d b_{1} b=b_{1} a d_{1} d+d_{1} c b_{1} b .
$$

Using various axioms for an integral domain, we see that

$$
\left(a_{1} d_{1}+b_{1} c_{1}\right) b d=b_{1} d_{1}(a d+b c)
$$

$$
\left(a_{1} d_{1}+b_{1} c_{1}, b_{1} d_{1}\right) \sim(a d+b c, b d)
$$

giving $\left(a_{1} d_{1}+b_{1} c_{1}, b_{1} d_{1}\right) \in[(a d+b c, b d)]$. This takes care of addition in $F$. For multiplication in $F$, on multiplying the equations $a_{1} b=b_{1} a$ and $c_{1} d=d_{1} c$, we obtain

$$
a_{1} b c_{1} d=b_{1} a d_{1} c
$$

so, using axioms of $D$, we get

$$
a_{1} c_{1} b d=b_{1} d_{1} a c
$$

which implies that

$$
\left(a_{1} c_{1}, b_{1} d_{1}\right) \sim(a c, b d)
$$

Thus $\left(a_{1} c_{1}, b_{1} d_{1}\right) \in[(a c, b d)]$, which completes the proof.

It is important to understand the meaning of the last lemma and the necessity for proving it. This completes our Step 2.

Step 3 Step 3 is routine, but it is good for us to work through a few of these details. The reason for this is that we cannot work through them unless we understand what we have done. Thus working through them will contribute to our understanding of this construction. We list the things that must be proved and prove a couple of them. The rest are left to the exercises.

1. Addition in $F$ is commutative.

Proof Now $[(a, b)]+[(c, d)]$ is by definition $[(a d+b c, b d)]$. Also $[(c, d)]+[(a, b)]$ is by definition $[(c b+d a, d b)]$. We need to show that $(a d+b c, b d) \sim(c b+d a, d b)$. This is true, since $a d+b c=c b+d a$ and $b d=d b$, by the axioms of $D$.

2. Addition is associative.
3. $[(0,1)]$ is an identity element for addition in $F$.
4. $[(-a, b)]$ is an additive inverse for $[(a, b)]$ in $F$.
5. Multiplication in $F$ is associative.
6. Multiplication in $F$ is commutative.
7. The distributive laws hold in $F$.
8. $[(1,1)]$ is a multiplicative identity element in $F$.
9. If $[(a, b)] \in F$ is not the additive identity element, then $a \neq 0$ in $D$ and $[(b, a)]$ is a multiplicative inverse for $[(a, b)]$.

Proof Let $[(a, b)] \in F$. If $a=0$, then

$$
a 1=b 0=0,
$$

so

$$
(a, b) \sim(0,1),
$$

that is, $[(a, b)]=[(0,1)]$. But $[(0,1)]$ is the additive identity by Part 3. Thus if $[(a, b)]$ is not the additive identity in $F$, we have $a \neq 0$, so it makes sense to talk about $[(b, a)]$ in $F$. Now $[(a, b)][(b, a)]=[(a b, b a)]$. But in $D$ we have $a b=b a$, so $(a b) 1=(b a) 1$, and

$$
(a b, b a) \sim(1,1) .
$$

Thus

$$
[(a, b)][(b, a)]=[(1,1)],
$$

and $[(1,1)]$ is the multiplicative identity by Part 8 .

This completes Step 3.

Step 4 It remains for us to show that $F$ can be regarded as containing $D$. To do this, we show that there is an isomorphism $i$ of $D$ with a subdomain of $F$. Then if we rename the image of $D$ under $i$ using the names of the elements of $D$, we will be done. The next lemma gives us this isomorphism. We use the letter $i$ for this isomorphism to suggest injection (see the footnote on page 4); we will inject $D$ into $F$.

21.4 Lemma The map $i: D \rightarrow F$ given by $i(a)=[(a, 1)]$ is an isomorphism of $D$ with a subring of $F$.

Proof For $a$ and $b$ in $D$, we have

$$
i(a+b)=[(a+b, 1)] .
$$

Also,

$$
i(a)+i(b)=[(a, 1)]+[(b, 1)]=[(a 1+1 b, 1)]=[(a+b, 1)] \text {. }
$$

so $i(a+b)=i(a)+i(b)$. Furthermore,

$$
i(a b)=[(a b, 1)],
$$

while

$$
i(a) i(b)=[(a, 1)][(b, 1)]=[(a b, 1)],
$$

so $i(a b)=i(a) i(b)$.

It remains for us to show only that $i$ is one to one. If $i(a)=i(b)$, then

$$
[(a, 1)]=[(b, 1)],
$$

so $(a, 1) \sim(b, 1)$ giving $a 1=1 b$; that is,

$$
a=b \text {. }
$$

Thus $i$ is an isomorphism of $D$ with $i[D]$, and, of course, $i[D]$ is then a subdomain of $F$.

Since $[(a, b)]=[(a, 1)][(1, b)]=[(a, 1)] /[(b, 1)]=i(a) / i(b)$ clearly holds in $F$, we have now proved the following theorem.

21.5 Theorem Any integral domain $D$ can be enlarged to (or embedded in) a field $F$ such that every element of $F$ can be expressed as a quotient of two elements of $D$. (Such a field $F$ is a field of quotients of $D$.)

## Uniqueness

We said in the beginning that $F$ could be regarded in some sense as a minimal field containing $D$. This is intuitively evident, since every field containing $D$ must contain all elements $a / b$ for every $a, b \in D$ with $b \neq 0$. The next theorem will show that every field containing $D$ contains a subfield which is a field of quotients of $D$, and that any two fields of quotients of $D$ are isomorphic.

21.6 Theorem Let $F$ be a field of quotients of $D$ and let $L$ be any field containing $D$. Then there exists a map $\psi: F \rightarrow L$ that gives an isomorphism of $F$ with a subfield of $L$ such that $\psi(a)=a$ for $a \in D$.

Proof The subring and mapping diagram in Fig. 21.7 may help you to visualize the situation for this theorem.

An element of $F$ is of the form $a /_{F} b$ where $/_{F}$ denotes the quotient of $a \in D$ by $b \in D$ regarded as elements of $F$. We of course want to map $a / F b$ onto $a / L b$ where $L_{L}$ denotes the quotient of elements in $L$. The main job will be to show that such a map is well defined.

We must define $\psi: F \rightarrow L$, and we start by defining

$$
\psi(a)=a \quad \text { for } \quad a \in D
$$

Every $x \in F$ is a quotient $a / F b$ of some two elements $a$ and $b, b \neq 0$, of $D$. Let us attempt to define $\psi$ by

$$
\psi(a / F b)=\psi(a) / L \psi(b)
$$

We must first show that this map $\psi$ is sensible and well-defined. Since $\psi$ is the identity on $D$, for $b \neq 0$ we have $\psi(b) \neq 0$, so our definition of $\psi(a / F b)$ as $\psi(a) /_{L} \psi(b)$ makes sense. If $a / F b=c / F d$ in $F$, then $a d=b c$ in $D$, so $\psi(a d)=\psi(b c)$. But since $\psi$ is the identity on $D$,

$$
\psi(a d)=\psi(a) \psi(d) \quad \text { and } \quad \psi(b c)=\psi(b) \psi(c)
$$

Thus

$$
\psi(a) / L \psi(b)=\psi(c) / L \psi(d)
$$

in $L$, so $\psi$ is well-defined.

The equations

$$
\psi(x y)=\psi(x) \psi(y)
$$

21.7 Figure
and

$$
\psi(x+y)=\psi(x)+\psi(y)
$$

follow easily from the definition of $\psi$ on $F$ and from the fact that $\psi$ is the identity on $D$.

If $\psi(a / F b)=\psi(c / F d)$, we have

$$
\psi(a) / L \psi(b)=\psi(c) / L \psi(d)
$$

so

$$
\psi(a) \psi(d)=\psi(b) \psi(c) .
$$

Since $\psi$ is the identity on $D$, we then deduce that $a d=b c$, so $a / F b=c / F d$. Thus $\psi$ is one to one.

By definition, $\psi(a)=a$ for $a \in D$.

21.8 Corollary Every field $L$ containing an integral domain $D$ contains a field of quotients of $D$.

Proof In the proof of Theorem 21.6 every element of the subfield $\psi[F]$ of $L$ is a quotient in $L$ of elements of $D$.

21.9 Corollary Any two fields of quotients of an integral domain $D$ are isomorphic.

Proof Suppose in Theorem 21.6 that $L$ is a field of quotients of $D$, so that every element $x$ of $L$ can be expressed in the form $a / L b$ for $a, b \in D$. Then $L$ is the field $\psi[F]$ of the proof of Theorem 21.6 and is thus isomorphic to $F$.

12. Let $R$ be a nonzero commutative ring, and let $T$ be a nonempty subset of $R$ closed under multiplication and containing neither 0 nor divisors of 0 . Starting with $R \times T$ and otherwise exactly following the construction in this section, we can show that the ring $R$ can be enlarged to a partial ring of quotients $Q(R, T)$. Think about this for 15 minutes or so; look back over the construction and see why things still work. In particular, show the following:

The attempt to enlarge $R$ to a commutative ring with unity in which every nonzero element of $T$ is a unit must fail if $T$ contains an element a that is a divisor of 0 , for a divisor of 0 cannot also be a unit. Try to discover where a construction parallel to that in the text but starting with $R \times T$ first runs into trouble. In particular, for $R=\mathbb{Z}_{6}$ and $T=\{1,2,4\}$, illustrate the first difficulty encountered. [Hint: It is in Step 1.]

## Polynomials in an Indeterminate

We all have a pretty workable idea of what constitutes a polynomial in $x$ with coefficients in a ring $R$. We can guess how to add and multiply such polynomials and know what is meant by the degree of a polynomial. We expect that the set $R[x]$ of all polynomials with coefficients in the ring $R$ is itself a ring with the usual operations of polynomial addition and multiplication, and that $R$ is a subring of $R[x]$. However, we will be working with polynomials from a slightly different viewpoint than the approach in high school algebra or calculus, and there are a few things that we want to say.

In the first place, we will call $x$ an indeterminate rather than a variable. Suppose, for example that our ring of coefficients is $\mathbb{Z}$. One of the polynomials in the ring $\mathbb{Z}[x]$ is $1 x$, which we shall write simply as $x$. Now $x$ is not 1 or 2 or any of the other elements of $\mathbb{Z}[x]$. Thus from now on we will never write such things as " $x=1$ " or " $x=2$," as we have done in other courses. We call $x$ an indeterminate rather than a variable to emphasize this change. Also, we will never write an expression such as " $x^{2}-4=0$," simply because $x^{2}-4$ is not the zero polynomial in our ring $\mathbb{Z}[x]$. We are accustomed to speaking of "solving a polynomial equation," and will be spending a lot of time in the remainder of our text discussing this, but we will always refer to it as "finding a zero of a polynomial." In summary, we try to be careful in our discussion of algebraic structures not to say in one context that things are equal and in another context that they are not equal.

## Historical Note

$\mathrm{T}$ he use of $x$ and other letters near the end of the alphabet to represent an "indeterminate" is due to René Descartes (1596-1650). Earlier, François Viete (1540-1603) had used vowels for indeterminates and consonants for known quantities. Descartes is also responsible for the first publication of the factor theorem (Corollary 23.3) in his work The Geometry, which appeared as an appendix to his Discourse on Method (1637). This work also contained the first publication of the basic concepts of analytic geometry; Descartes showed how geometric curves can be described algebraically.

Descartes was born to a wealthy family in La Haye, France; since he was always of delicate health, he formed the habit of spending his mornings in bed. It was at these times that he accomplished his most productive work. The Discourse on Method was Descartes' attempt to show the proper procedures for "searching for truth in the sciences." The first step in this process was to reject as absolutely false everything of which he had the least doubt; but, since it was necessary that he who was thinking was "something," he conceived his first principle of philosophy: "I think, therefore I am." The most enlightening parts of the Discourse on Method, however, are the three appendices: The Optics, The Geometry, and The Meteorology. It was here that Descartes provided examples of how he actually applied his method. Among the important ideas Descartes discovered and published in these works were the sine law of refraction of light, the basics of the theory of equations, and a geometric explanation of the rainbow.

In 1649, Descartes was invited by Queen Christina of Sweden to come to Stockholm to tutor her. Unfortunately, the Queen required him, contrary to his long-established habits, to rise at an early hour. He soon contracted a lung disease and died in 1650.

If a person knows nothing about polynomials, it is not an easy task to describe precisely the nature of a polynomial in $x$ with coefficients in a ring $R$. If we just define such a polynomial to be a finite formal sum

$$
\sum_{i=0}^{n} a_{i} x^{i}=a_{0}+a_{1} x+\cdots+a_{n} x^{n}
$$

where $a_{i} \in R$, we get ourselves into a bit of trouble. For surely $0+a_{1} x$ and $0+a_{1} x+$ $0 x^{2}$ are different as formal sums, but we want to regard them as the same polynomial. A practical solution to this problem is to define a polynomial as an infinite formal sum

$$
\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} a_{i} x^{i}=a_{0}+a_{1} x+\cdots+a_{n} x^{n}+\cdots
$$

where $a_{i}=0$ for all but a finite number of values of $i$. Now there is no problem of having more than one formal sum represent what we wish to consider a single polynomial.

22.1 Definition Let $R$ be a ring. A polynomial $f(x)$ with coefficients in $R$ is an infinite formal sum

$$
\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} a_{i} x^{i}=a_{0}+a_{1} x+\cdots+a_{n} x^{n}+\cdots,
$$

where $a_{i} \in R$ and $a_{i}=0$ for all but a finite number of values of $i$. The $a_{i}$ are coefficients of $f(x)$. If for some $i \geq 0$ it is true that $a_{i} \neq 0$, the largest such value of $i$ is the degree of $f(x)$. If all $a_{i}=0$, then the degree of $f(x)$ is undefined. ${ }^{\dagger}$

To simplify working with polynomials, let us agree that if $f(x)=a_{0}+a_{1} x+\cdots+$ $a_{n} x^{n}+\cdots$ has $a_{i}=0$ for $i>n$, then we may denote $f(x)$ by $a_{0}+a_{1} x+\cdots+a_{n} x^{n}$. Also, if $R$ has unity $1 \neq 0$, we will write a term $1 x^{k}$ in such a sum as $x^{k}$. For example, in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$, we will write the polynomial $2+1 x$ as $2+x$. Finally, we shall agree that we may omit altogether from the formal sum any term $0 x^{i}$, or $a_{0}$ if $a_{0}=0$ but not all $a_{i}=0$. Thus $0,2, x$, and $2+x^{2}$ are polynomials with coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}$. An element of $R$ is a constant polynomial.

Addition and multiplication of polynomials with coefficients in a ring $R$ are defined in a way familiar to us. If

$$
f(x)=a_{0}+a_{1} x+\cdots+a_{n} x^{n}+\cdots
$$

and

$$
g(x)=b_{0}+b_{1} x+\cdots+b_{n} x^{n}+\cdots,
$$

then for polynomial addition, we have

$$
f(x)+g(x)=c_{0}+c_{1} x+\cdots+c_{n} x^{n}+\cdots \text { where } c_{n}=a_{n}+b_{n} \text {, }
$$[^12]and for polynomial multiplication, we have

$$
f(x) g(x)=d_{0}+d_{1} x+\cdots+d_{n} x^{n}+\cdots \text { where } d_{n}=\sum_{i=0}^{n} a_{i} b_{n-i}
$$

Observe that both $c_{i}$ and $d_{i}$ are 0 for all but a finite number of values of $i$, so these definitions make sense. Note that $\sum_{i=0}^{n} a_{i} b_{n-i}$ need not equal $\sum_{i=0}^{n} b_{i} a_{n-i}$ if $R$ is not commutative. With these definitions of addition and multiplication, we have the following theorem.

22.2 Theorem The set $R[x]$ of all polynomials in an indeterminate $x$ with coefficients in a ring $R$ is a ring under polynomial addition and multiplication. If $R$ is commutative, then so is $R[x]$, and if $R$ has unity $1 \neq 0$, then 1 is also unity for $R[x]$.

Proof That $\langle R[x],+\rangle$ is an abelian group is apparent. The associative law for multiplication and the distributive laws are straightforward, but slightly cumbersome, computations. We illustrate by proving the associative law.

Applying ring axioms to $a_{i}, b_{j}, c_{k} \in R$, we obtain

$$
\begin{aligned}
{\left[\left(\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} a_{i} x^{i}\right)\left(\sum_{j=0}^{\infty} b_{j} x^{j}\right)\right]\left(\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} c_{k} x^{k}\right) } & =\left[\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left(\sum_{i=0}^{n} a_{i} b_{n-i}\right) x^{n}\right]\left(\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} c_{k} x^{k}\right) \\
& =\sum_{s=0}^{\infty}\left[\sum_{n=0}^{s}\left(\sum_{i=0}^{n} a_{i} b_{n-i}\right) c_{s-n}\right] x^{s} \\
& =\sum_{s=0}^{\infty}\left(\sum_{i+j+k=s} a_{i} b_{j} c_{k}\right) x^{s} \\
& =\sum_{s=0}^{\infty}\left[\sum_{m=0}^{s} a_{s-m}\left(\sum_{j=0}^{m} b_{j} c_{m-j}\right)\right] x^{s} \\
& =\left(\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} a_{i} x^{i}\right)\left[\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}\left(\sum_{j=0}^{m} b_{j} c_{m-j}\right) x^{m}\right] \\
& =\left(\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} a_{i} x^{i}\right)\left[\left(\sum_{j=0}^{\infty} b_{j} x^{j}\right)\left(\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} c_{k} x^{k}\right)\right] .
\end{aligned}
$$

Whew!! In this computation, the fourth expression, having just two summation signs, should be viewed as the value of the triple product $f(x) g(x) h(x)$ of these polynomials under this associative multiplication. (In a similar fashion, we view $f(g(h(x)))$ as the value of the associative composition $(f \circ g \circ h)(x)$ of three functions $f, g$, and $h$.)

The distributive laws are similarly proved. (See Exercise 26.)

The comments prior to the statement of the theorem show that $R[x]$ is a commutative ring if $R$ is commutative, and a unity $1 \neq 0$ in $R$ is also unity for $R[x]$, in view of the definition of multiplication in $R[x]$.

Thus $\mathbb{Z}[x]$ is the ring of polynomials in the indeterminate $x$ with integral coefficients, $Q[x]$ the ring of polynomials in $x$ with rational coefficients, and so on.

22.3 Example $\quad$ In $\mathbb{Z}_{2}[x]$, we have

$$
(x+1)^{2}=(x+1)(x+1)=x^{2}+(1+1) x+1=x^{2}+1 .
$$

Still working in $\mathbb{Z}_{2}[x]$, we obtain

$$
(x+1)+(x+1)=(1+1) x+(1+1)=0 x+0=0 .
$$

If $R$ is a ring and $x$ and $y$ are two indeterminates, then we can form the ring $(R[x])[y]$, that is, the ring of polynomials in $y$ with coefficients that are polynomials in $x$. Every polynomial in $y$ with coefficients that are polynomials in $x$ can be rewritten in a natural way as a polynomial in $x$ with coefficients that are polynomials in $y$ as illustrated by Exercise 20 . This indicates that $(R[x])[y]$ is naturally isomorphic to $(R[y])[x]$, although a careful proof is tedious. We shall identify these rings by means of this natural isomorphism, and shall consider this ring $R[x, y]$ the ring of polynomials in two indeterminates $x$ and $y$ with coefficients in $R$. The ring $R\left[x_{1}, \cdots, x_{n}\right]$ of polynomials in the $n$ indeterminates $x_{i}$ with coefficients in $R$ is similarly defined.

We leave as Exercise 24 the proof that if $D$ is an integral domain then so is $D[x]$. In particular, if $F$ is a field, then $F[x]$ is an integral domain. Note that $F[x]$ is not a field, for $x$ is not a unit in $F[x]$. That is, there is no polynomial $f(x) \in F[x]$ such that $x f(x)=1$. By Theorem 21.5, one can construct the field of quotients $F(x)$ of $F[x]$. Any element in $F(x)$ can be represented as a quotient $f(x) / g(x)$ of two polynomials in $F[x]$ with $g(x) \neq 0$. We similarly define $F\left(x_{1}, \cdots, x_{n}\right)$ to be the field of quotients of $F\left[x_{1}, \cdots, x_{n}\right]$. This field $F\left(x_{1}, \cdots, x_{n}\right)$ is the field of rational functions in $n$ indeterminates over $F$. These fields play a very important role in algebraic geometry.

## The Evaluation Homomorphisms

We are now ready to proceed to show how homomorphisms can be used to study what we have always referred to as "solving a polynomial equation." Let $E$ and $F$ be fields, with $F$ a subfield of $E$, that is, $F \leq E$. The next theorem asserts the existence of very important homomorphisms of $F[x]$ into $E$. These homomorphisms will be the fundamental tools for much of the rest of our work.

22.4 Theorem (The Evaluation Homomorphisms for Field Theory) Let $F$ be a subfield of a field $E$, let $\alpha$ be any element of $E$, and let $x$ be an indeterminate. The map $\phi_{\alpha}: F[x] \rightarrow E$ defined by

$$
\phi_{\alpha}\left(a_{0}+a_{1} x+\cdots+a_{n} x^{n}\right)=a_{0}+a_{1} \alpha+\cdots+a_{n} \alpha^{n}
$$

for $\left(a_{0}+a_{1} x+\cdots+a_{n} x^{n}\right) \in F[x]$ is a homomorphism of $F[x]$ into $E$. Also, $\phi_{\alpha}(x)=$ $\alpha$, and $\phi_{\alpha}$ maps $F$ isomorphically by the identity map; that is, $\phi_{\alpha}(a)=a$ for $a \in F$. The homomorphism $\phi_{\alpha}$ is evaluation at $\alpha$.

Proof The subfield and mapping diagram in Fig. 22.5 may help us to visualize this situation. The dashed lines indicate an element of the set. The theorem is really an immediate

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_01_27_9289ad7bed1dd2e5e553g-207.jpg?height=409&width=591&top_left_y=462&top_left_x=905)

22.5 Figure

consequence of our definitions of addition and multiplication in $F[x]$. The map $\phi_{\alpha}$ is well defined, that is, independent of our representation of $f(x) \in F[x]$ as a finite sum

$$
a_{0}+a_{1} x+\cdots+a_{n} x^{n}
$$

since such a finite sum representing $f(x)$ can be changed only by insertion or deletion of terms $0 x^{i}$, which does not affect the value of $\phi_{\alpha}(f(x))$.

If $f(x)=a_{0}+a_{1} x+\cdots+a_{n} x^{n}, g(x)=b_{0}+b_{1} x+\cdots+b_{m} x^{m}$, and $h(x)=$ $f(x)+g(x)=c_{0}+c_{1} x+\cdots+c_{r} x^{r}$, then

$$
\phi_{\alpha}(f(x)+g(x))=\phi_{\alpha}(h(x))=c_{0}+c_{1} \alpha+\cdots+c_{r} \alpha^{r},
$$

while

$$
\phi_{\alpha}(f(x))+\phi_{\alpha}(g(x))=\left(a_{0}+a_{1} \alpha+\cdots+a_{n} \alpha^{n}\right)+\left(b_{0}+b_{1} \alpha+\cdots+b_{m} \alpha^{m}\right) .
$$

Since by definition of polynomial addition we have $c_{i}=a_{i}+b_{i}$, we see that

$$
\phi_{\alpha}(f(x)+g(x))=\phi_{\alpha}(f(x))+\phi_{\alpha}(g(x)) .
$$

Turning to multiplication, we see that if

$$
f(x) g(x)=d_{0}+d_{1} x+\cdots+d_{s} x^{s}
$$

then

$$
\phi_{\alpha}(f(x) g(x))=d_{0}+d_{1} \alpha+\cdots+d_{s} \alpha^{s}
$$

while

$$
\left[\phi_{\alpha}(f(x))\right]\left[\phi_{\alpha}(g(x))\right]=\left(a_{0}+a_{1} \alpha+\cdots+\alpha_{n} \alpha^{n}\right)\left(b_{0}+b_{1} \alpha+\cdots+b_{m} \alpha^{m}\right)
$$

Since by definition of polynomial multiplication $d_{j}=\sum_{i=0}^{j} a_{i} b_{j-i}$, we see that

$$
\phi_{\alpha}(f(x) g(x))=\left[\phi_{\alpha}(f(x))\right]\left[\phi_{\alpha}(g(x))\right] .
$$

Thus $\phi_{\alpha}$ is a homomorphism.

The very definition of $\phi_{\alpha}$ applied to a constant polynomial $a \in F[x]$, where $a \in F$, gives $\phi_{\alpha}(a)=a$, so $\phi_{\alpha}$ maps $F$ isomorphically by the identity map. Again by definition of $\phi_{\alpha}$, we have $\phi_{\alpha}(x)=\phi_{\alpha}(1 x)=1 \alpha=\alpha$.

We point out that this theorem is valid with the identical proof if $F$ and $E$ are merely commutative rings with unity rather than fields. However, we shall be interested primarily in the case in which they are fields.

It is hard to overemphasize the importance of this simple theorem for us. It is the very foundation for all of our further work in field theory. It is so simple that it could justifiably be called an observation rather than a theorem. It was perhaps a little misleading to write out the proof because the polynomial notation makes it look so complicated that you may be fooled into thinking it is a difficult theorem.

22.6 Example $\quad$ Let $F$ be $\mathbb{Q}$ and $E$ be $\mathbb{R}$ in Theorem 22.4, and consider the evaluation homomorphism $\phi_{0}: \mathbb{Q}[x] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. Here

$$
\phi_{0}\left(a_{0}+a_{1} x+\cdots+a_{n} x^{n}\right)=a_{0}+a_{1} 0+\cdots+a_{n} 0^{n}=a_{0} .
$$

Thus every polynomial is mapped onto its constant term.

22.7 Example $\quad$ Let $F$ be $\mathbb{Q}$ and $E$ be $\mathbb{R}$ in Theorem 22.4 and consider the evaluation homomorphism $\phi_{2}: \mathbb{Q}[x] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. Here

$$
\phi_{2}\left(a_{0}+a_{1} x+\cdots+a_{n} x^{n}\right)=a_{0}+a_{1} 2+\cdots+a_{n} 2^{n} .
$$

Note that

$$
\phi_{2}\left(x^{2}+x-6\right)=2^{2}+2-6=0 .
$$

Thus $x^{2}+x-6$ is in the kernel $N$ of $\phi_{2}$. Of course,

$$
x^{2}+x-6=(x-2)(x+3)
$$

and the reason that $\phi_{2}\left(x^{2}+x-6\right)=0$ is that $\phi_{2}(x-2)=2-2=0$.

22.8 Example $\quad$ Let $F$ be $\mathbb{Q}$ and $E$ be $\mathbb{C}$ in Theorem 22.4 and consider the evaluation homomorphism $\phi_{i}: \mathbb{Q}[x] \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$. Here

$$
\phi_{i}\left(a_{0}+a_{1} x+\cdots+a_{n} x^{n}\right)=a_{0}+a_{1} i+\cdots+a_{n} i^{n}
$$

and $\phi_{i}(x)=i$. Note that

$$
\phi_{i}\left(x^{2}+1\right)=i^{2}+1=0
$$

so $x^{2}+1$ is in the kernel $N$ of $\phi_{i}$.

22.9 Example $\quad$ Let $F$ be $\mathbb{Q}$ and let $E$ be $\mathbb{R}$ in Theorem 22.4 and consider the evaluation homomorphism $\phi_{\pi}: \mathbb{Q}[x] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. Here

$$
\phi_{\pi}\left(a_{0}+a_{1} x+\cdots+a_{n} x^{n}\right)=a_{0}+a_{1} \pi+\cdots+a_{n} \pi^{n} .
$$

It can be proved that $a_{0}+a_{1} \pi+\cdots+a_{n} \pi^{n}=0$ if and only if $a_{i}=0$ for $i=0,1, \cdots, n$. Thus the kernel of $\phi_{\pi}$ is $\{0\}$, and $\phi_{\pi}$ is a one-to-one map. This shows that all formal polynomials in $\pi$ with rational coefficients form a ring isomorphic to $\mathbb{Q}[x]$ in a natural way with $\phi_{\pi}(x)=\pi$.

## The New Approach

We now complete the connection between our new ideas and the classical concept of solving a polynomial equation. Rather than speak of solving a polynomial equation, we shall refer to finding a zero of a polynomial.

22.10 Definition Let $F$ be a subfield of a field $E$, and let $\alpha$ be an element of $E$. Let $f(x)=a_{0}+$ $a_{1} x+\cdots+a_{n} x^{n}$ be in $F[x]$, and let $\phi_{\alpha}: F[x] \rightarrow E$ be the evaluation homomorphism of Theorem 22.4. Let $f(\alpha)$ denote

$$
\phi_{\alpha}(f(x))=a_{0}+a_{1} \alpha+\cdots+a_{n} \alpha^{n} .
$$

If $f(\alpha)=0$, then $\alpha$ is a zero of $f(x)$.

In terms of this definition, we can rephrase the classical problem of finding all real numbers $r$ such that $r^{2}+r-6=0$ by letting $F=\mathbb{Q}$ and $E=\mathbb{R}$ and finding all $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$ such that

$$
\phi_{\alpha}\left(x^{2}+x-6\right)=0,
$$

that is, finding all zeros of $x^{2}+x-6$ in $\mathbb{R}$. Both problems have the same answer, since

$$
\left\{\alpha \in \mathbb{R} \mid \phi_{\alpha}\left(x^{2}+x-6\right)=0\right\}=\left\{r \in \mathbb{R} \mid r^{2}+r-6=0\right\}=\{2,-3\} .
$$

It may seem that we have merely succeeded in making a simple problem seem quite complicated. In fact, what we have done is to phrase the problem in the language of mappings, and we can now use all the mapping machinery that we have developed and will continue to develop for its solution.

## Our Basic Goal

We continue to attempt to put our future work in perspective. Sections 26 and 27 are concerned with topics in ring theory that are analogous to the material on factor groups and homomorphisms for group theory. However, our aim in developing these analogous concepts for rings will be quite different from our aims in group theory. In group theory we used the concepts of factor groups and homomorphisms to study the structure of a given group and to determine the types of group structures of certain orders that could exist. We will be talking about homomorphisms and factor rings in Section 26
with an eye to finding zeros of polynomials, which is one of the oldest and most fundamental problems in algebra. Let us take a moment to talk about this aim in the light of mathematical history, using the language of "solving polynomial equations" to which we are accustomed.

We start with the Pythagorean school of mathematics of about 525 B.C. The Pythagoreans worked with the assumption that all distances are commensurable; that is, given distances $a$ and $b$, there should exist a unit of distance $u$ and integers $n$ and $m$ such that $a=(n)(u)$ and $b=(m)(u)$. In terms of numbers, then, thinking of $u$ as being one unit of distance, they maintained that all numbers are integers. This idea of commensurability can be rephrased according to our ideas as an assertion that all numbers are rational, for if $a$ and $b$ are rational numbers, then each is an integral multiple of the reciprocal of the least common multiple of their denominators. For example, if $a=\frac{7}{12}$ and $b=\frac{19}{15}$, then $a=(35)\left(\frac{1}{60}\right)$ and $b=(76)\left(\frac{1}{60}\right)$.

The Pythagoreans knew, of course, what is now called the Pythagorean theorem; that is, for a right triangle with legs of lengths $a$ and $b$ and a hypotenuse of length $c$,

$$
a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}
$$

They also had to grant the existence of a hypotenuse of a right triangle having two legs of equal length, say one unit each. The hypotenuse of such a right triangle would, as we know, have to have a length of $\sqrt{2}$. Imagine then their consternation and dismay when one of their society—according to some stories it was Pythagoras himselfcame up with the embarrassing fact that is stated in our terminology in the following theorem.

22.11 Theorem The polynomial $x^{2}-2$ has no zeros in the rational numbers. Thus $\sqrt{2}$ is not a rational number.

Proof Suppose that $m / n$ for $m, n \in \mathbb{Z}$ is a rational number such that $(m / n)^{2}=2$. We assume that we have canceled any factors common to $m$ and $n$, so that the fraction $m / n$ is in lowest terms with $\operatorname{gcd}(m, n)=1$. Then

$$
m^{2}=2 n^{2}
$$

where both $m^{2}$ and $2 n^{2}$ are integers. Since $m^{2}$ and $2 n^{2}$ are the same integer, and since 2 is a factor of $2 n^{2}$, we see that 2 must be one of the factors of $m^{2}$. But as a square, $m^{2}$ has as factors the factors of $m$ repeated twice. Thus $m^{2}$ must have two factors 2 . Then $2 n^{2}$ must have two factors 2 , so $n^{2}$ must have 2 as a factor, and consequently $n$ has 2 as a factor. We have deduced from $m^{2}=2 n^{2}$ that both $m$ and $n$ must be divisible by 2 , contradicting the fact that the fraction $m / n$ is in lowest terms. Thus we have $2 \neq(m / n)^{2}$ for any $m, n \in \mathbb{Z}$.

Thus the Pythagoreans ran right into the question of a solution of a polynomial equation, $x^{2}-2=0$. We refer the student to Shanks [36, Chapter 3], for a lively and totally delightful account of this Pythagorean dilemma and its significance in mathematics.

## Historical Note

$\mathrm{T}$ The solution of polynomial equations has been a goal of mathematics for nearly 4000 years. The Babylonians developed versions of the quadratic formula to solve quadratic equations. For example, to solve $x^{2}-x=870$, the Babylonian scribe instructed his students to take half of $1\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)$, square it $\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)$, and add that to 870 . The square root of $870 \frac{1}{4}$, namely $29 \frac{1}{2}$, is then added to $\frac{1}{2}$ to give 30 as the answer. What the scribes did not discuss, however, was what to do if the square root in this process was not a rational number. Chinese mathematicians, however, from about 200 B.C., discovered a method similar to what is now called Horner's method to solve quadratic equations numerically; since they used a decimal system, they were able in principle to carry out the computation to as many places as necessary and could therefore ignore the distinction between rational and irrational solutions. The Chinese, in fact, extended their numerical techniques to polynomial equations of higher degree. In the Arab world, the Persian poet-mathematician Omar Khayyam (1048-1131) developed methods for solving cubic equations geometrically by finding the point(s) of intersection of appropriately chosen conic sections, while Sharaf al-Din al-Tusi (died 1213) used, in effect, techniques of calculus to determine whether or not a cubic equation had a real positive root. It was the Italian Girolamo Cardano (1501-1576) who first published a procedure for solving cubic equations algebraically.

In our motivation of the definition of a group, we commented on the necessity of having negative numbers, so that equations such as $x+2=0$ might have solutions. The introduction of negative numbers caused a certain amount of consternation in some philosophical circles. We can visualize 1 apple, 2 apples, and even $\frac{13}{11}$ apples, but how can we point to anything and say that it is -17 apples? Finally, consideration of the equation $x^{2}+1=0$ led to the introduction of the number $i$. The very name of an "imaginary number" given to $i$ shows how this number was regarded. Even today, many students are led by this name to regard $i$ with some degree of suspicion. The negative numbers were introduced to us at such an early stage in our mathematical development that we accepted them without question.

We first met polynomials in high school freshman algebra. The first problem there was to learn how to add, multiply, and factor polynomials. Then, in both freshman algebra and in the second course in algebra in high school, considerable emphasis was placed on solving polynomial equations. These topics are exactly those with which we shall be concerned. The difference is that while in high school, only polynomials with real number coefficients were considered, we shall be doing our work for polynomials with coefficients from any field.

Once we have developed the machinery of homomorphisms and factor rings in Section 26, we will proceed with our basic goal: to show that given any polynomial of degree $\geq 1$, where the coefficients of the polynomial may be from any field, we can find a zero of this polynomial in some field containing the given field. After the machinery is developed in Sections 26 and 27, the achievement of this goal will be very easy, and is really a very elegant piece of mathematics.

All this fuss may seem ridiculous, but just think back in history. This is the culmination of more than 2000 years of mathematical endeavor in working with polynomial equations. After achieving our basic goal, we shall spend the rest of our time studying the
nature of these solutions of polynomial equations. We need have no fear in approaching this material. We shall be dealing with familiar topics of high school algebra. This work should seem much more natural than group theory.

In conclusion, we remark that the machinery of factor rings and ring homomorphisms is not really necessary in order for us to achieve our basic goal. For a direct demonstration, see Artin [27, p. 29]. However, factor rings and ring homomorphisms are fundamental ideas that we should grasp, and our basic goal will follow very easily once we have mastered them.

29. Let $R$ be a ring, and let $R^{R}$ be the set of all functions mapping $R$ into $R$. For $\phi, \psi \in R^{R}$, define the sum $\phi+\psi$ by

$$

and the product $\phi \cdot \psi$ by

c. Show that if $F$ is a finite field, then $F^{F}=P_{F}$. [Hint: Of course, $P_{F} \subseteq F^{F}$. Let $F$ have as elements $a_{1}, \cdots, a_{n}$. Note that if

f_{i}(x)=c\left(x-a_{1}\right) \cdots\left(x-a_{i-1}\right)\left(x-a_{i+1}\right) \cdots\left(x-a_{n}\right),
$$

then $f_{i}\left(a_{j}\right)=0$ for $j \neq i$, and the value $f_{i}\left(a_{i}\right)$ can be controlled by the choice of $c \in F$. Use this to show that every function on $F$ is a polynomial function.]

## section 23 Factorization of Polynomials over a Field

Recall that we are concerned with finding zeros of polynomials. Let $E$ and $F$ be fields, with $F \leq E$. Suppose that $f(x) \in F[x]$ factors in $F[x]$, so that $f(x)=g(x) h(x)$ for $g(x), h(x) \in F[x]$ and let $\alpha \in E$. Now for the evaluation homomorphism $\phi_{\alpha}$, we have

$$
f(\alpha)=\phi_{\alpha}(f(x))=\phi_{\alpha}(g(x) h(x))=\phi_{\alpha}(g(x)) \phi_{\alpha}(h(x))=g(\alpha) h(\alpha) .
$$

Thus if $\alpha \in E$, then $f(\alpha)=0$ if and only if either $g(\alpha)=0$ or $h(\alpha)=0$. The attempt to find a zero of $f(x)$ is reduced to the problem of finding a zero of a factor of $f(x)$. This is one reason why it is useful to study factorization of polynomials.

## The Division Algorithm in $F[x]$

The following theorem is the basic tool for our work in this section. Note the similarity with the division algorithm for $\mathbb{Z}$ given in Theorem 6.3, the importance of which has been amply demonstrated.

(Division Algorithm for $\boldsymbol{F}[\boldsymbol{x}]$ ) Let

$$
f(x)=a_{n} x^{n}+a_{n-1} x^{n-1}+\cdots+a_{0}
$$

and

$$
g(x)=b_{m} x^{m}+b_{m-1} x^{m-1}+\cdots+b_{0}
$$

be two elements of $F[x]$, with $a_{n}$ and $b_{m}$ both nonzero elements of $F$ and $m>0$. Then there are unique polynomials $q(x)$ and $r(x)$ in $F[x]$ such that $f(x)=g(x) q(x)+r(x)$, where either $r(x)=0$ or the degree of $r(x)$ is less than the degree $m$ of $g(x)$.

Proof Consider the set $S=\{f(x)-g(x) s(x) \mid s(x) \in F[x]\}$. If $0 \in S$ then there exists an $s(x)$ such that $f(x)-g(x) s(x)=0$, so $f(x)=g(x) s(x)$. Taking $q(x)=s(x)$ and $r(x)=0$, we are done. Otherwise, let $r(x)$ be an element of minimal degree in $S$. Then

$$
f(x)=g(x) q(x)+r(x)
$$

for some $q(x) \in F[x]$. We must show that the degree of $r(x)$ is less than $m$. Suppose that

$$
r(x)=c_{t} x^{t}+c_{t-1} x^{t-1}+\cdots+c_{0},
$$

with $c_{j} \in F$ and $c_{t} \neq 0$. If $t \geq m$, then

$$
f(x)-q(x) g(x)-\left(c_{t} / b_{m}\right) x^{t-m} g(x)=r(x)-\left(c_{t} / b_{m}\right) x^{t-m} g(x),
$$

and the latter is of the form

$$
r(x)-\left(c_{t} x^{t}+\text { terms of lower degree }\right),
$$

which is a polynomial of degree lower than $t$, the degree of $r(x)$. However, the polynomial in Eq. (1) can be written in the form

$$
f(x)-g(x)\left[q(x)+\left(c_{t} / b_{m}\right) x^{t-m}\right],
$$

so it is in $S$, contradicting the fact that $r(x)$ was selected to have minimal degree in $S$. Thus the degree of $r(x)$ is less than the degree $m$ of $g(x)$.

For uniqueness, if

$$
f(x)=g(x) q_{1}(x)+r_{1}(x)
$$

and

$$
f(x)=g(x) q_{2}(x)+r_{2}(x)
$$

then subtracting we have

$$
g(x)\left[q_{1}(x)-q_{2}(x)\right]=r_{2}(x)-r_{1}(x) .
$$

Because either $r_{2}(x)-r_{1}(x)=0$ or the degree of $r_{2}(x)-r_{1}(x)$ is less than the degree of $g(x)$, this can hold only if $q_{1}(x)-q_{2}(x)=0$ so $q_{1}(x)=q_{2}(x)$. Then we must have $r_{2}(x)-r_{1}(x)=0$ so $r_{1}(x)=r_{2}(x)$.

We can compute the polynomials $q(x)$ and $r(x)$ of Theorem 23.1 by long division just as we divided polynomials in $\mathbb{R}[x]$ in high school.

23.2 Example Let us work with polynomials in $\mathbb{Z}_{5}[x]$ and divide

$$
f(x)=x^{4}-3 x^{3}+2 x^{2}+4 x-1
$$

by $g(x)=x^{2}-2 x+3$ to find $q(x)$ and $r(x)$ of Theorem 23.1. The long division should be easy to follow, but remember that we are in $\mathbb{Z}_{5}[x]$, so, for example, $4 x-(-3 x)=2 x$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \begin{array}{c}
x^{2}-x-3 \\
x ^ { 2 } - 2 x + 3 \longdiv { x ^ { 4 } - 3 x ^ { 3 } + 2 x ^ { 2 } + 4 x - 1 }
\end{array} \\
& \frac{x^{4}-2 x^{3}+3 x^{2}}{-x^{3}-x^{2}}+4 x \\
& \frac{-x^{3}+2 x^{2}-3 x}{-3 x^{2}+2 x-1} \\
& \frac{-3 x^{2}+x-4}{x+3}
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus

$$
q(x)=x^{2}-x-3, \quad \text { and } \quad r(x)=x+3
$$

We give three important corollaries of Theorem 23.1. The first one appears in high school algebra for the special case $F[x]=\mathbb{R}[x]$. We phrase our proof in terms of the mapping (homomorphism) approach described in Section 22.

23.3 Corollary (Factor Theorem) An element $a \in F$ is a zero of $f(x) \in F[x]$ if and only if $x-a$ is a factor of $f(x)$ in $F[x]$.

Proof Suppose that for $a \in F$ we have $f(a)=0$. By Theorem 23.1, there exist $q(x)$, $r(x) \in F[x]$ such that

$$
f(x)=(x-a) q(x)+r(x),
$$

where either $r(x)=0$ or the degree of $r(x)$ is less than 1 . Thus we must have $r(x)=c$ for $c \in F$, so

$$
f(x)=(x-a) q(x)+c .
$$

Applying our evaluation homomorphism, $\phi_{a}: F[x] \rightarrow F$ of Theorem 22.4, we find

$$
0=f(a)=0 q(a)+c
$$

so it must be that $c=0$. Then $f(x)=(x-a) q(x)$, so $x-a$ is a factor of $f(x)$.

Conversely, if $x-a$ is a factor of $f(x)$ in $F[x]$, where $a \in F$, then applying our evaluation homomorpohism $\phi_{a}$ to $f(x)=(x-a) q(x)$, we have $f(a)=0 q(a)=0$.

23.4 Example Working again in $\mathbb{Z}_{5}[x]$, note that 1 is a zero of

$$
\left(x^{4}+3 x^{3}+2 x+4\right) \in \mathbb{Z}_{5}[x] .
$$

Thus by Corollary 23.3, we should be able to factor $x^{4}+3 x^{3}+2 x+4$ into $(x-1) q(x)$ in $\mathbb{Z}_{5}[x]$. Let us find the factorization by long division.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \frac{x^{3}+4 x^{2}+4 x+1}{x-1 \sqrt{x^{4}+3 x^{3}+}} \\
& \frac{x^{4}-x^{3}}{4 x^{3}} \\
& \frac{4 x^{3}-4 x^{2}}{4 x^{2}+2 x} \\
& \frac{4 x^{2}-4 x}{x+4} \\
& \frac{x-1}{0}
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus $x^{4}+3 x^{3}+2 x+4=(x-1)\left(x^{3}+4 x^{2}+4 x+1\right)$ in $\mathbb{Z}_{5}[x]$. Since 1 is seen to be a zero of $x^{3}+4 x^{2}+4 x+1$ also, we can divide this polynomial by $x-1$ and get

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \frac{x^{2}+4}{x - 1 \longdiv { x ^ { 3 } + 4 x ^ { 2 } + 4 x + 1 }} \\
& \frac{x^{3}-x^{2}}{0}+4 x+1 \\
& 4 x-4 \\
& 0
\end{aligned}
$$

Since $x^{2}+4$ still has 1 as a zero, we can divide again by $x-1$ and get

$$
\begin{aligned}
& x-1 \frac{x+1}{x^{2}+4} \\
& \frac{x^{2}-x}{x+4} \\
& \frac{x-1}{0}
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus $x^{4}+3 x^{3}+2 x+4=(x-1)^{3}(x+1)$ in $\mathbb{Z}_{5}[x]$.

The next corollary should also look familiar.

23.5 Corollary A nonzero polynomial $f(x) \in F[x]$ of degree $n$ can have at most $n$ zeros in a field $F$.

Proof The preceding corollary shows that if $a_{1} \in F$ is a zero of $f(x)$, then

$$
f(x)=\left(x-a_{1}\right) q_{1}(x),
$$

where, of course, the degree of $q_{1}(x)$ is $n-1$. A zero $a_{2} \in F$ of $q_{1}(x)$ then results in a factorization

$$
f(x)=\left(x-a_{1}\right)\left(x-a_{2}\right) q_{2}(x) .
$$

Continuing this process, we arrive at

$$
f(x)=\left(x-a_{1}\right) \cdots\left(x-a_{r}\right) q_{r}(x),
$$

where $q_{r}(x)$ has no further zeros in $F$. Since the degree of $f(x)$ is $n$, at most $n$ factors $\left(x-a_{i}\right)$ can appear on the right-hand side of the preceding equation, so $r \leq n$. Also, if $b \neq a_{i}$ for $i=1, \cdots, r$ and $b \in F$, then

$$
f(b)=\left(b-a_{1}\right) \cdots\left(b-a_{r}\right) q_{r}(b) \neq 0
$$

since $F$ has no divisors of 0 and none of $b-a_{i}$ or $q_{r}(b)$ are 0 by construction. Hence the $a_{i}$ for $i=1, \cdots, r \leq n$ are all the zeros in $F$ of $f(x)$.

Our final corollary is concerned with the structure of the multiplicative group $F^{*}$ of nonzero elements of a field $F$, rather than with factorization in $F[x]$. It may at first seem surprising that such a result follows from the division algorithm in $F[x]$, but recall that the result that a subgroup of a cyclic group is cyclic follows from the division algorithm in $\mathbb{Z}$.

23.6 Corollary If $G$ is a finite subgroup of the multiplicative group $\left\langle F^{*}, \cdot\right\rangle$ of a field $F$, then $G$ is cyclic. In particular, the multiplicative group of all nonzero elements of a finite field is cyclic.

Proof By Theorem 11.12 as a finite abelian group, $G$ is isomorphic to a direct product $\mathbb{Z}_{d_{1}} \times$ $\mathbb{Z}_{d_{2}} \times \cdots \times \mathbb{Z}_{d_{r}}$, where each $d_{i}$ is a power of a prime. Let us think of each of the $\mathbb{Z}_{d_{i}}$ as a cyclic group of order $d_{i}$ in multiplicative notation. Let $m$ be the least common multiple of all the $d_{i}$ for $i=1,2, \cdots, r$; note that $m \leq d_{1} d_{2} \cdots d_{r}$. If $a_{i} \in \mathbb{Z}_{d_{t}}$, then $a_{i}{ }^{d_{i}}=1$, so $a_{i}{ }^{m}=1$ since $d_{i}$ divides $m$. Thus for all $\alpha \in G$, we have $\alpha^{m}=1$, so every element of $G$ is zero of $x^{m}-1$. But $G$ has $d_{1} d_{2} \cdots d_{r}$ elements, while $x^{m}-1$ can have at most $m$ zeros in the field $F$ by Corollary 23.5, so $m \geq d_{1} d_{2} \cdots d_{r}$. Hence $m=d_{1} d_{2} \cdots d_{r}$, so the primes involved in the prime powers $d_{1}, d_{2}, \cdots, d_{r}$ are distinct, and the group $G$ is isomorphic to the cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}_{m}$.

Exercises 5 through 8 ask us to find all generators of the cyclic groups of units for some finite fields. The fact that the multiplicative group of units of a finite field is cyclic has been applied in algebraic coding.

## Irreducible Polynomials

Our next definition singles out a type of polynomial in $F[x]$ that will be of utmost importance to us. The concept is probably already familiar. We really are doing high school algebra in a more general setting.

23.7 Definition A nonconstant polynomial $f(x) \in F[x]$ is irreducible over $F$ or is an irreducible polynomial in $F[x]$ if $f(x)$ cannot be expressed as a product $g(x) h(x)$ of two polynomials $g(x)$ and $h(x)$ in $F[x]$ both of lower degree than the degree of $f(x)$. If $f(x) \in F[x]$ is a nonconstant polynomial that is not irreducible over $F$, then $f(x)$ is reducible over $F$.

Note that the preceding definition concerns the concept irreducible over $F$ and not just the concept irreducible. A polynomial $f(x)$ may be irreducible over $F$, but may not be irreducible if viewed over a larger field $E$ containing $F$. We illustrate this.

23.8 Example Theorem 22.11 shows that $x^{2}-2$ viewed in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$ has no zeros in $\mathbb{Q}$. This shows that $x^{2}-2$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$, for a factorization $x^{2}-2=(a x+b)(c x+d)$ for $a, b, c$, $d \in \mathbb{Q}$ would give rise to zeros of $x^{2}-2$ in $\mathbb{Q}$. However, $x^{2}-2$ viewed in $\mathbb{R}[x]$ is not irreducible over $\mathbb{R}$, because $x^{2}-2$ factors in $\mathbb{R}[x]$ into $(x-\sqrt{2})(x+\sqrt{2})$.

It is worthwhile to remember that the units in $F[x]$ are precisely the nonzero elements of $F$. Thus we could have defined an irreducible polynomial $f(x)$ as a nonconstant polynomial such that in any factorization $f(x)=g(x) h(x)$ in $F[x]$, either $g(x)$ or $h(x)$ is a unit.

23.9 Example Let us show that $f(x)=x^{3}+3 x+2$ viewed in $\mathbb{Z}_{5}[x]$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Z}_{5}$. If $x^{3}+$ $3 x+2$ factored in $\mathbb{Z}_{5}[x]$ into polynomials of lower degree then there would exist at least one linear factor of $f(x)$ of the form $x-a$ for some $a \in \mathbb{Z}_{5}$. But then $f(a)$ would be 0 , by Corollary 23.3. However, $f(0)=2, f(1)=1, f(-1)=-2, f(2)=1$, and $f(-2)=-2$, showing that $f(x)$ has no zeros in $\mathbb{Z}_{5}$. Thus $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Z}_{5}$. This test for irreducibility by finding zeros works nicely for quadratic and cubic polynomials over a finite field with a small number of elements.

Irreducible polynomials will play a very important role in our work from now on. The problem of determining whether a given $f(x) \in F[x]$ is irreducible over $F$ may be difficult. We now give some criteria for irreducibility that are useful in certain cases. One technique for determining irreducibility of quadratic and cubic polynomials was illustrated in Examples 23.8 and 23.9. We formalize it in a theorem.

23.10 Theorem Let $f(x) \in F[x]$, and let $f(x)$ be of degree 2 or 3 . Then $f(x)$ is reducible over $F$ if and only if it has a zero in $F$.

Proof If $f(x)$ is reducible so that $f(x)=g(x) h(x)$, where the degree of $g(x)$ and the degree of $h(x)$ are both less than the degree of $f(x)$, then since $f(x)$ is either quadratic or cubic, either $g(x)$ or $h(x)$ is of degree 1. If, say, $g(x)$ is of degree 1, then except for a possible factor in $F, g(x)$ is of the form $x-a$. Then $g(a)=0$, which implies that $f(a)=0$, so $f(x)$ has a zero in $F$.

Conversely, Corollary 23.3 shows that if $f(a)=0$ for $a \in F$, then $x-a$ is a factor of $f(x)$, so $f(x)$ is reducible.

We turn to some conditions for irreducibility over $\mathbb{Q}$ of polynomials in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$. The most important condition that we shall give is contained in the next theorem. We shall not prove this theorem here; it involves clearing denominators and gets a bit messy.

23.11 Theorem If $f(x) \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$, then $f(x)$ factors into a product of two polynomials of lower degrees $r$ and $s$ in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$ if and only if it has such a factorization with polynomials of the same degrees $r$ and $s$ in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$.

Proof The proof is omitted here.

23.12 Corollary If $f(x)=x^{n}+a_{n-1} x^{n-1}+\cdots+a_{0}$ is in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$ with $a_{0} \neq 0$, and if $f(x)$ has a zero in $\mathbb{Q}$, then it has a zero $m$ in $\mathbb{Z}$, and $m$ must divide $a_{0}$.

Proof If $f(x)$ has a zero $a$ in $\mathbb{Q}$, then $f(x)$ has a linear factor $x-a$ in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$ by Corollary 23.3. But then by Theorem 23.11, $f(x)$ has a factorization with a linear factor in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$, so for some $m \in \mathbb{Z}$ we must have

$$
f(x)=(x-m)\left(x^{n-1}+\cdots-a_{0} / m\right) .
$$

Thus $a_{0} / m$ is in $\mathbb{Z}$, so $m$ divides $a_{0}$.

23.13 Example Corollary 23.12 gives us another proof of the irreducibility of $x^{2}-2$ over $\mathbb{Q}$, for $x^{2}-2$ factors nontrivially in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$ if and only if it has a zero in $\mathbb{Q}$ by Theorem 23.10. By Corollary 23.12 , it has a zero in $\mathbb{Q}$ if and only if it has a zero in $\mathbb{Z}$, and moreover the only possibilities are the divisors $\pm 1$ and $\pm 2$ of 2 . A check shows that none of these numbers is a zero of $x^{2}-2$.

23.14 Example Let us use Theorem 23.11 to show that

$$
f(x)=x^{4}-2 x^{2}+8 x+1
$$

viewed in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$. If $f(x)$ has a linear factor in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$, then it has a zero in $\mathbb{Z}$, and by Corollary 23.12, this zero would have to be a divisor in $\mathbb{Z}$ of 1 , that is, either $\pm 1$. But $f(1)=8$, and $f(-1)=-8$, so such a factorization is impossible.

If $f(x)$ factors into two quadratic factors in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$, then by Theorem 23.11, it has a factorization.

$$
\left(x^{2}+a x+b\right)\left(x^{2}+c x+d\right)
$$

in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$. Equating coefficients of powers of $x$, we find that we must have

$$
b d=1, \quad a d+b c=8, \quad a c+b+d=-2, \quad \text { and } \quad a+c=0
$$

for integers $a, b, c, d \in \mathbb{Z}$. From $b d=1$, we see that either $b=d=1$ or $b=d=-1$. In any case, $b=d$ and from $a d+b c=8$, we deduce that $d(a+c)=8$. But this is impossible since $a+c=0$. Thus a factorization into two quadratic polynomials is also impossible and $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$.

We conclude our irreducibility criteria with the famous Eisenstein criterion for irreducibility. An additional very useful criterion is given in Exercise 37.

23.15 Theorem (Eisenstein Criterion) Let $p \in \mathbb{Z}$ be a prime. Suppose that $f(x)=a_{n} x^{n}+\cdots+a_{0}$ is in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$, and $a_{n} \not \equiv 0(\bmod p)$, but $a_{i}=0(\bmod p)$ for all $i<n$, with $a_{0} \not \equiv 0\left(\bmod p^{2}\right)$. Then $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$.

Proof By Theorem 23.11 we need only show that $f(x)$ does not factor into polynomials of lower degree in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$. If

$$
f(x)=\left(b_{r} x^{r}+\cdots+b_{0}\right)\left(c_{s} x^{s}+\cdots+c_{0}\right)
$$

is a factorization in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$, with $b_{r} \neq 0, c_{s} \neq 0$ and $r, s<n$, then $a_{0} \not \equiv 0\left(\bmod p^{2}\right)$ implies that $b_{0}$ and $c_{0}$ are not both congruent to 0 modulo $p$. Suppose that $b_{0} \not \equiv 0(\bmod p)$ and $c_{0} \equiv 0(\bmod p)$. Now $a_{n} \not \equiv 0(\bmod p)$ implies that $b_{r}, c_{s} \not \equiv 0(\bmod p)$, since $a_{n}=b_{r} c_{s}$. Let $m$ be the smallest value of $k$ such that $c_{k} \not \equiv 0(\bmod p)$. Then

$$
a_{m}=b_{0} c_{m}+b_{1} c_{m-1}+\cdots+\left\{\begin{array}{l}
b_{m} c_{0} \text { if } r \geq m, \\
b_{r} c_{m-r} \text { if } r<m .
\end{array}\right.
$$

The fact that neither $b_{0}$ nor $c_{m}$ are congruent to 0 modulo $p$ while $c_{m-1}, \cdots, c_{0}$ are all congruent to 0 modulo $p$ implies that $a_{m} \not \equiv 0$ modulo $p$, so $m=n$. Consequently, $s=n$, contradicting our assumption that $s<n$; that is, that our factorization was nontrivial.

Note that if we take $p=2$, the Eisenstein criterion gives us still another proof of the irreducibility of $x^{2}-2$ over $\mathbb{Q}$.

23.16 Example Taking $p=3$, we see by Theorem 23.15 that

$$
25 x^{5}-9 x^{4}-3 x^{2}-12
$$

is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$.

### 23.17 Corollary The polynomial

$$
\Phi_{p}(x)=\frac{x^{p}-1}{x-1}=x^{p-1}+x^{p-2}+\cdots+x+1
$$

is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$ for any prime $p$.

Proof Again by Theorem 23.11, we need only consider factorizations in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$. We remarked following Theorem 22.4 that its proof actually shows that evaluation homomorphims can be used for commutative rings. Here we want to use the evaluation homomorphism $\phi_{x+1}: \mathbb{Q}[x] \rightarrow \mathbb{Q}[x]$. It is natural for us to denote $\phi_{x+1}(f(x))$ by $f(x+1)$ for $f(x) \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$. Let

$$
g(x)=\Phi_{p}(x+1)=\frac{(x+1)^{p}-1}{(x+1)-1}=\frac{x^{p}+\left(\begin{array}{c}
p \\
1
\end{array}\right) x^{p-1}+\cdots+p x}{x} .
$$

The coefficient of $x^{p-r}$ for $0<r<p$ is the binomial coefficient $p ! /[r !(p-r) !]$ which is divisible by $p$ because $p$ divides $p$ ! but does not divide either $r$ ! or $(p-r)$ ! when $0<r<p$. Thus

$$
g(x)=x^{p-1}+\left(\begin{array}{c}
p \\
1
\end{array}\right) x^{p-2}+\cdots+p
$$

satisifies the Eisenstein criterion for the prime $p$ and is thus irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$. But if $\Phi_{p}(x)=h(x) r(x)$ were a nontrivial factorization of $\Phi_{p}(x)$ in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$, then

$$
\Phi_{p}(x+1)=g(x)=h(x+1) r(x+1)
$$

would give a nontrivial factorization of $g(x)$ in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$. Thus $\Phi_{p}(x)$ must also be irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$.

The polynomial $\Phi_{p}(x)$ in Corollary 23.17 is the $\boldsymbol{p}^{\text {th }}$ cyclotomic polynomial.

## Uniqueness of Factorization in $F[x]$

Polynomials in $F[x]$ can be factored into a product of irreducible polynomials in $F[x]$ in an essentially unique way. For $f(x), g(x) \in F[x]$ we say that $g(x)$ divides $f(x)$ in $F[x]$ if there exists $q(x) \in F[x]$ such that $f(x)=g(x) q(x)$. Note the similarity of the theorem that follows with boxed Property (1) for $\mathbb{Z}$ following Example 6.9.

23.18 Theorem Let $p(x)$ be an irreducible polynomial in $F[x]$. If $p(x)$ divides $r(x) s(x)$ for $r(x), s(x) \in$ $F[x]$, then either $p(x)$ divides $r(x)$ or $p(x)$ divides $s(x)$.

Proof We delay the proof of this theorem to Section 27. (See Theorem 27.27.)

23.19 Corollary If $p(x)$ is irreducible in $F[x]$ and $p(x)$ divides the product $r_{1}(x) \cdots r_{n}(x)$ for $r_{i}(x) \in F[x]$, then $p(x)$ divides $r_{i}(x)$ for at least one $i$.

Proof Using mathematical induction, we find that this is immediate from Theorem 23.18.

23.20 Theorem If $F$ is a field, then every nonconstant polynomial $f(x) \in F[x]$ can be factored in $F[x]$ into a product of irreducible polynomials, the irreducible polynomials being unique except for order and for unit (that is, nonzero constant) factors in $F$.

Proof Let $f(x) \in F[x]$ be a nonconstant polynomial. If $f(x)$ is not irreducible, then $f(x)=$ $g(x) h(x)$, with the degree of $g(x)$ and the degree of $h(x)$ both less than the degree of $f(x)$. If $g(x)$ and $h(x)$ are both irreducible, we stop here. If not, at least one of them factors into polynomials of lower degree. Continuing this process, we arrive at a factorization

$$
f(x)=p_{1}(x) p_{2}(x) \cdots p_{r}(x)
$$

where $p_{i}(x)$ is irreducible for $i=1,2, \cdots, r$.

It remains for us to show uniqueness. Suppose that

$$
f(x)=p_{1}(x) p_{2}(x) \cdots p_{r}(x)=q_{1}(x) q_{2}(x) \cdots q_{s}(x)
$$

are two factorizations of $f(x)$ into irreducible polynomials. Then by Corollary 23.19, $p_{1}(x)$ divides some $q_{j}(x)$, let us assume $q_{1}(x)$. Since $q_{1}(x)$ is irreducible,

$$
q_{1}(x)=u_{1} p_{1}(x),
$$

where $u_{1} \neq 0$, but $u_{1}$ is in $F$ and thus is a unit. Then substituting $u_{1} p_{1}(x)$ for $q_{1}(x)$ and canceling, we get

$$
p_{2}(x) \cdots p_{r}(x)=u_{1} q_{2}(x) \cdots q_{s}(x) .
$$

By a similar argument, say $q_{2}(x)=u_{2} p_{2}(x)$, so

$$
p_{3}(x) \cdots p_{r}(x)=u_{1} u_{2} q_{3}(x) \cdots q_{s}(x)
$$

Continuing in this manner, we eventually arrive at

$$
1=u_{1} u_{2} \cdots u_{r} q_{r+1}(x) \cdots q_{s}(x) .
$$

This is only possible if $s=r$, so that this equation is actually $1=u_{1} u_{2} \cdots u_{r}$. Thus the irreducible factors $p_{i}(x)$ and $q_{j}(x)$ were the same except possibly for order and unit factors.

23.21 Example Example 23.4 shows a factorization of $x^{4}+3 x^{3}+2 x+4$ in $\mathbb{Z}_{5}[x]$ is $(x-1)^{3}(x+1)$. These irreducible factors in $\mathbb{Z}_{5}[x]$ are only unique up to units in $\mathbb{Z}_{5}[x]$, that is, nonzero constants in $\mathbb{Z}_{5}$. For example, $(x-1)^{3}(x+1)=(x-1)^{2}(2 x-2)(3 x+3)$.

## SECTION 24 †NONCOMMUTATIVE EXAMPLES

Thus far, the only example we have presented of a ring that is not commutative is the ring $M_{n}(F)$ of all $n \times n$ matrices with entries in a field $F$. We shall be doing almost nothing with noncommutative rings and strictly skew fields. To show that there are other important noncommutative rings occurring very naturally in algebra, we give several examples of such rings.

## Rings of Endomorphisms

Let $A$ be any abelian group. A homomorphism of $A$ into itself is an endomorphism of $A$. Let the set of all endomorphisms of $A$ be $\operatorname{End}(A)$. Since the composition of two homomorphisms of $A$ into itself is again such a homomorphism, we define multiplication on $\operatorname{End}(A)$ by function composition, and thus multiplication is associative.

To define addition, for $\phi, \psi \in \operatorname{End}(A)$, we have to describe the value of $(\phi+\psi)$ on each $a \in A$. Define

$$
(\phi+\psi)(a)=\phi(a)+\psi(a) .
$$

Since

$$
\begin{aligned}
(\phi+\psi)(a+b) & =\phi(a+b)+\psi(a+b) \\
& =[\phi(a)+\phi(b)]+[\psi(a)+\psi(b)] \\
& =[\phi(a)+\psi(a)]+[\phi(b)+\psi(b)] \\
& =(\phi+\psi)(a)+(\phi+\psi)(b)
\end{aligned}
$$

we see that $\phi+\psi$ is again in $\operatorname{End}(A)$.

Since $A$ is commutative, we have

$$
(\phi+\psi)(a)=\phi(a)+\psi(a)=\psi(a)+\phi(a)=(\psi+\phi)(a)
$$

for all $a \in A$, so $\phi+\psi=\psi+\phi$ and addition in $\operatorname{End}(A)$ is commutative. The associativity of addition follows from[^13]

$$
\begin{aligned}
{[\phi+(\psi+\theta)](a) } & =\phi(a)+[(\psi+\theta)(a)] \\
& =\phi(a)+[\psi(a)+\theta(a)] \\
& =[\phi(a)+\psi(a)]+\theta(a) \\
& =(\phi+\psi)(a)+\theta(a) \\
& =[(\phi+\psi)+\theta](a) .
\end{aligned}
$$

If $e$ is the additive identity of $A$, then the homomorphism 0 defined by

$$
0(a)=e
$$

for $a \in A$ is an additive identity in $\operatorname{End}(A)$. Finally, for

$$
\phi \in \operatorname{End}(A),
$$

$-\phi$ defined by

$$
(-\phi)(a)=-\phi(a)
$$

is in $\operatorname{End}(A)$, since

$$
\begin{aligned}
(-\phi)(a+b) & =-\phi(a+b)=-[\phi(a)+\phi(b)] \\
& =-\phi(a)-\phi(b)=(-\phi)(a)+(-\phi)(b)
\end{aligned}
$$

and $\phi+(-\phi)=0$. Thus $\langle\operatorname{End}(A),+\rangle$ is an abelian group.

Note that we have not yet used the fact that our functions are homomorphisms except to show that $\phi+\psi$ and $-\phi$ are again homomorphisms. Thus the set $A^{A}$ of all functions from $A$ into $A$ is an abelian group under exactly the same definition of addition, and, of course, function composition again gives a nice associative multiplication in $A^{A}$. However, we do need the fact that these functions in $\operatorname{End}(A)$ are homomorphisms now to prove the left distributive law in $\operatorname{End}(A)$. Except for this left distributive law, $\left\langle A^{A},+, \cdot\right\rangle$ satisfies all the axioms for a ring. Let $\phi, \psi$, and $\theta$ be in $\operatorname{End}(A)$, and let $a \in A$. Then

$$
(\theta(\phi+\psi))(a)=\theta((\phi+\psi)(a))=\theta(\phi(a)+\psi(a))
$$

Since $\theta$ is a homomorphism,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\theta(\phi(a)+\psi(a)) & =\theta(\phi(a))+\theta(\psi(a)) \\
& =(\theta \phi)(a)+(\theta \psi)(a) \\
& =(\theta \phi+\theta \psi)(a) .
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus $\theta(\phi+\psi)=\theta \phi+\theta \psi$. The right distributive law causes no trouble, even in $A^{A}$, and follows from

$$
\begin{aligned}
((\psi+\theta) \phi)(a) & =(\psi+\theta)(\phi(a))=\psi(\phi(a))+\theta(\phi(a)) \\
& =(\psi \phi)(a)+(\theta \phi)(a)=(\psi \phi+\theta \phi)(a)
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus we have proved the following theorem.

24.1 Theorem The set $\operatorname{End}(A)$ of all endomorphisms of an abelian group $A$ forms a ring under homomorphism addition and homomorphism multiplication (function composition).

Again, to show relevance to this section, we should give an example showing that $\operatorname{End}(A)$ need not be commutative. Since function composition is in general not commutative, this seems reasonable to expect. However, $\operatorname{End}(A)$ may be commutative in some cases. Indeed, Exercise 15 asks us to show that $\operatorname{End}(\langle\mathbb{Z},+\rangle)$ is commutative.

24.2 Example Consider the abelian group $\langle\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z},+\rangle$ discussed in Section 11. It is straightforward to verify that two elements of $\operatorname{End}(\langle\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z},+\rangle)$ are $\phi$ and $\psi$ defined by

$$
\phi((m, n))=(m+n, 0) \quad \text { and } \quad \psi((m, n))=(0, n) .
$$

Note that $\phi$ maps everything onto the first factor of $\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}$, and $\psi$ collapses the first factor. Thus

$$
(\psi \phi)(m, n)=\psi(m+n, 0)=(0,0)
$$

while

$$
(\phi \psi)(m, n)=\phi(0, n)=(n, 0)
$$

Hence $\phi \psi \neq \psi \phi$.

24.3 Example Let $F$ be a field of characteristic zero, and let $\langle F[x],+\rangle$ be the additive group of the ring $F[x]$ of polynomials with coefficients in $F$. For this example, let us denote this additive group by $F[x]$, to simplify this notation. We can consider $\operatorname{End}(F[x])$. One element of $\operatorname{End}(F[x])$ acts on each polynomial in $F[x]$ by multiplying it by $x$. Let this endomorphism be $X$, so

$$
X\left(a_{0}+a_{1} x+a_{2} x^{2}+\cdots+a_{n} x^{n}\right)=a_{0} x+a_{1} x^{2}+a_{2} x^{3}+\cdots+a_{n} x^{n+1} .
$$

Another element of $\operatorname{End}(F[x])$ is formal differentiation with respect to $x$. (The familiar formula "the derivation of a sum is the sum of the derivatives" guarantees that differentiation is an endomorphism of $F[x]$.) Let $Y$ be this endomorphism, so

$$
Y\left(a_{0}+a_{1} x+a_{2} x^{2}+\cdots+a_{n} x^{n}\right)=a_{1}+2 a_{2} x+\cdots+n a_{n} x^{n-1} .
$$

Exercise 17 asks us to show that $Y X-X Y=1$, where 1 is unity (the identity map) in $\operatorname{End}(F[x])$. Thus $X Y \neq Y X$. Multiplication of polynomials in $F[x]$ by any element of $F$ also gives an element of End $(F[x])$. The subring of $\operatorname{End}(F[x])$ generated by $X$ and $Y$ and multiplications by elements of $F$ is the Weyl algebra and is important in quantum mechanics.

## Group Rings and Group Algebras

Let $G=\left\{g_{i} \mid i \in I\right\}$ be any group written multiplicatively and let $R$ be any commutative ring with nonzero unity. Let $R G$ be the set of all formal sums.

$$
\sum_{i \in I} a_{i} g_{i}
$$

for $a_{i} \in R$ and $g_{i} \in G$, where all but a finite number of the $a_{i}$ are 0 . Define the sum of two elements of $R G$ by

$$
\left(\sum_{i \in I} a_{i} g_{i}\right)+\left(\sum_{i \in I} b_{i} g_{i}\right)=\sum_{i \in I}\left(a_{i}+b_{i}\right) g_{i}
$$

Observe that $\left(a_{i}+b_{i}\right)=0$ except for a finite number of indices $i$, so $\Sigma_{i \in I}\left(a_{i}+b_{i}\right) g_{i}$ is again in $R G$. It is immediate that $\langle R G,+\rangle$ is an abelian group with additive identity $\Sigma_{i \in I} 0 g_{i}$.

Multiplication of two elements of $R G$ is defined by the use of the multiplications in $G$ and $R$ as follows:

$$
\left(\sum_{i \in I} a_{i} g_{i}\right)\left(\sum_{i \in I} b_{i} g_{i}\right)=\sum_{i \in I}\left(\sum_{g_{j} g_{k}=g_{i}} a_{j} b_{k}\right) g_{i}
$$

Naively, we formally distribute the sum $\Sigma_{i \in I} a_{i} g_{i}$ over the sum $\Sigma_{i \in I} b_{i} g_{i}$ and rename a term $a_{j} g_{j} b_{k} g_{k}$ by $a_{j} b_{k} g_{i}$ where $g_{j} g_{k}=g_{i}$ in $G$. Since $a_{i}$ and $b_{i}$ are 0 for all but a finite number of $i$, the sum $\Sigma_{g_{j} g_{k}=g_{i}} a_{j} b_{k}$ contains only a finite number of nonzero summands $a_{j} b_{k} \in R$ and may thus be viewed as an element of $R$. Again, at most a finite number of such sums $\Sigma_{g_{j} g_{k}=g_{i}} a_{j} b_{k}$ are nonzero. Thus multiplication is closed on $R G$.

The distributive laws follow at once from the definition of addition and the formal way we used distributivity to define multiplication. For the associativity of multiplication

$$
\begin{aligned}
\left(\sum_{i \in I} a_{i} g_{i}\right)\left[\left(\sum_{i \in I} b_{i} g_{i}\right)\left(\sum_{i \in I} c_{i} g_{i}\right)\right] & =\left(\sum_{i \in I} a_{i} g_{i}\right)\left[\sum_{i \in I}\left(\sum_{g_{j} g_{k}=g_{i}} b_{j} c_{k}\right) g_{i}\right] \\
& =\sum_{i \in I}\left(\sum_{g_{h} g_{j} g_{k}=g_{i}} a_{h} b_{j} c_{k}\right) g_{i} \\
& =\left[\sum_{i \in I}\left(\sum_{g_{h} g_{j}=g_{i}} a_{h} b_{j}\right) g_{i}\right]\left(\sum_{i \in I} c_{i} g_{i}\right) \\
& =\left[\left(\sum_{i \in I} a_{i} g_{i}\right)\left(\sum_{i \in I} b_{i} g_{i}\right)\right]\left(\sum_{i \in I} c_{i} g_{i}\right) .
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus we have proved the following theorem.

24.4 Theorem If $G$ is any group written multiplicatively and $R$ is a commutative ring with nonzero unity, then $\langle R G,+, \cdot\rangle$ is a ring.

Corresponding to each $g \in G$, we have an element $1 g$ in $R G$. If we identify (rename) $1 g$ with $g$, we see that $\langle R G, \cdot\rangle$ can be considered to contain $G$ naturally as a multiplicative subsystem. Thus, if $G$ is not abelian, $R G$ is not a commutative ring.

24.5 Definition The ring $R G$ defined above is the group ring of $G$ over $R$. If $F$ is a field, then $F G$ is the group algebra of $G$ over $F$.

24.6 Example Let us give the addition and multiplication tables for the group algebra $\mathbb{Z}_{2} G$, where $G=\{e, a\}$ is cyclic of order 2 . The elements of $Z_{2} G$ are

$$
0 e+0 a, \quad 0 e+1 a, \quad 1 e+0 a, \quad \text { and } \quad 1 e+1 a
$$

If we denote these elements in the obvious, natural way by

$$
0, \quad a, \quad e, \quad \text { and } \quad e+a,
$$

24.7 Table

| + | 0 | $a$ | $e$ | $e+a$ |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 0 | 0 | $a$ | $e$ | $e+a$ |
| $a$ | $a$ | 0 | $e+a$ | $e$ |
| $e$ | $e$ | $e+a$ | 0 | $a$ |
| $e+a$ | $e+a$ | $e$ | $a$ | 0 |

24.8 Table

|  | 0 | $a$ | $e$ | $e+a$ |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| $a$ | 0 | $e$ | $a$ | $e+a$ |
| $e$ | 0 | $a$ | $e$ | $e+a$ |
| $e+a$ | 0 | $e+a$ | $e+a$ | 0 |

respectively, we get Tables 24.7 and 24.8. For example, to see that $(e+a)(e+a)=0$, we have

$$
(1 e+1 a)(1 e+1 a)=(1+1) e+(1+1) a=0 e+0 a .
$$

This example shows that a group algebra may have 0 divisors. Indeed, this is usually the case.

## The Quaternions

We have not yet given an example of a noncommutative division ring. The quaternions of Hamilton are the standard example of a strictly skew field; let us describe them.

## Historical Note

Cir William Rowan Hamilton (1805-1865) dis$\checkmark$ covered quaternions in 1843 while he was searching for a way to multiply number triplets (vectors in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ ). Six years earlier he had developed the complex numbers abstractly as pairs $(a, b)$ of real numbers with addition $(a, b)+\left(a^{\prime}+b^{\prime}\right)=$ $\left(a+a^{\prime}, b+b^{\prime}\right)$ and multiplication $(a, b)\left(a^{\prime} b^{\prime}\right)=$ $\left(a a^{\prime}-b b^{\prime}, a b^{\prime}+a^{\prime} b\right)$; he was then looking for an analogous multiplication for 3 -vectors that was distributive and such that the length of the product vector was the product of the lengths of the factors. After many unsuccessful attempts to multiply vectors of the form $a+b i+c j$ (where $1, i, j$ are mutually perpendicular), he realized while walking along the Royal Canal in Dublin on October 16, 1843 , that he needed a new "imaginary symbol" $k$ to be perpendicular to the other three elements. He could not "resist the impulse ... to cut with a knife on a stone of Brougham Bridge" the fundamental defining formulas on page 225 for multiplying these quaternions.

The quaternions were the first known example of a strictly skew field. Though many others were subsequently discovered, it was eventually noted that none were finite. In 1909 Joseph Henry Maclagan Wedderburn (1882-1948), then a preceptor at Princeton University, gave the first proof of Theorem 24.10.

Let the set $\mathbb{H}$, for Hamilton, be $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$. Now $\langle\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R},+\rangle$ is a group under addition by components, the direct product of $\mathbb{R}$ under addition with itself four times. This gives the operation of addition on $\mathbb{H}$. Let us rename certain elements of $\mathbb{H}$. We shall let

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
1=(1,0,0,0), & i=(0,1,0,0), \\
j=(0,0,1,0), & \text { and } \quad k=(0,0,0,1) .
\end{array}
$$

We furthermore agree to let

$$
\begin{aligned}
a_{1} & =\left(a_{1}, 0,0,0\right), \quad a_{2} i=\left(0, a_{2}, 0,0\right), \\
a_{3} j & =\left(0,0, a_{3}, 0\right) \quad \text { and } \quad a_{4} k=\left(0,0,0, a_{4}\right) .
\end{aligned}
$$

In view of our definition of addition, we then have

$$
\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, a_{4}\right)=a_{1}+a_{2} i+a_{3} j+a_{4} k
$$

Thus

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \left(a_{1}+a_{2} i+a_{3} j+a_{4} k\right)+\left(b_{1}+b_{2} i+b_{3} j+b_{4} k\right) \\
& \quad=\left(a_{1}+b_{1}\right)+\left(a_{2}+b_{2}\right) i+\left(a_{3}+b_{3}\right) j+\left(a_{4}+b_{4}\right) k
\end{aligned}
$$

To define multiplication on $\mathbb{H}$, we start by defining

$$
\begin{array}{r}
1 a=a 1=a \text { for } a \in \mathbb{H}, \\
i^{2}=j^{2}=k^{2}=-1,
\end{array}
$$

and

$$
i j=k, \quad j k=i, \quad k i=j, \quad j i=-k, \quad k j=-i, \quad \text { and } \quad i k=-j .
$$

Note the similarity with the so-called cross product of vectors. These formulas are easy to remember if we think of the sequence

$$
i, j, k, i, j, k
$$

The product from left to right of two adjacent elements is the next one to the right. The product from right to left of two adjacent elements is the negative of the next one to the left. We then define a product to be what it must be to make the distributive laws hold, namely,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\left(a_{1}+\right. & \left.a_{2} i+a_{3} j+a_{4} k\right)\left(b_{1}+b_{2} i+b_{3} j+b_{4} k\right) \\
= & \left(a_{1} b_{1}-a_{2} b_{2}-a_{3} b_{3}-a_{4} b_{4}\right)+\left(a_{1} b_{2}+a_{2} b_{1}+a_{3} b_{4}-a_{4} b_{3}\right) i \\
& +\left(a_{1} b_{3}-a_{2} b_{4}+a_{3} b_{1}+a_{4} b_{2}\right) j \\
& +\left(a_{1} b_{4}+a_{2} b_{3}-a_{3} b_{2}+a_{4} b_{1}\right) k
\end{aligned}
$$

Exercise 19 shows that the quaternions are isomorphic to a subring of $M_{2}(\mathbb{C})$, so multiplication is associative. Since $i j=k$ and $j i=-k$, we see that multiplication is not commutative, so $\mathbb{H}$ is definitely not a field. Turning to the existence of multiplicative inverses, let $a=a_{1}+a_{2} i+a_{3} j+a_{4} k$, with not all $a_{i}=0$. Computation shows that

$$
\left(a_{1}+a_{2} i+a_{3} j+a_{4} k\right)\left(a_{1}-a_{2} i-a_{3} j-a_{4} k\right)=a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+a_{3}^{2}+a_{4}^{2} .
$$

If we let

$$
|a|^{2}=a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+a_{3}^{2}+a_{4}^{2} \quad \text { and } \quad \bar{a}=a_{1}-a_{3} j-a_{4} k \text {, }
$$

we see that

$$
\frac{\bar{a}}{|a|^{2}}=\frac{a_{1}}{|a|^{2}}-\left(\frac{a_{2}}{|a|^{2}}\right) i-\left(\frac{a_{3}}{|a|^{2}}\right) j-\left(\frac{a_{4}}{|a|^{2}}\right) k
$$

is a multiplicative inverse for $a$. We consider that we have demonstrated the following theorem.

24.9 Theorem The quaternions $\mathbb{H}$ form a strictly skew field under addition and multiplication.

Note that $G=\{ \pm 1, \pm i, \pm j, \pm k\}$ is a group of order 8 under quaternion multiplication. This group is generated by $i$ and $j$, where

$$
i^{4}=1, \quad j^{2}=i^{2} \quad \text { and } \quad j i=i^{3} j \text {. }
$$

There are no finite strictly skew fields. This is the content of a famous theorem of Wedderburn, which we state without proof.

24.10 Theorem (Wedderburn's Theorem) Every finite division ring is a field.

Proof See Artin, Nesbitt, and Thrall [24] for a proof of Wedderburn's theorem.

## SECTION 25 ORdered Rings AND Fields

We are familiar with the inequality relation $<$ on the set $\mathbb{R}$ and on any subset of $\mathbb{R}$. (We remind you that relations were discussed in Section 0. See Definition 0.7.) We regard $<$ as providing an ordering of the real numbers. In this section, we study orderings of rings and fields. We assume throughout this section that the rings under discussion have nonzero unity 1.

In the real numbers, $a<b$ if and only if $b-a$ is positive, so the order relation $<$ on $\mathbb{R}$ is completely determined if we know which real numbers are positive. We use the idea of labeling certain elements as positive to define the notion of order in a ring.[^14]

25.1 Definition An ordered ring is a ring $R$ together with a nonempty subset $P$ of $R$ satisfying these two properties.

Closure $\quad$ For all $a, b \in P$, both $a+b$ and $a b$ are in $P$.

Trichotomy For each $a \in R$, one and only one of the following holds:

$$
a \in P, \quad a=0, \quad-a \in P .
$$

Elements of $P$ are called "positive."

It is easy to see that if $R$ is an ordered ring with set $P$ of positive elements and $S$ is a subring of $R$, then $P \cap S$ satisfies the requirements for a set of positive elements in the ring $S$, and thus gives an ordering of $S$. (See Exercise 26.) This is the induced ordering from the given ordering of $R$.

We observe at once that for each of the rings $\mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathbb{R}$ the set of elements that we have always considered to be positive satisfies the conditions of closure and trichotomy. We will refer to the familiar ordering of these rings and the induced ordering on their subrings as the natural ordering. We now give an unfamiliar illustration.

25.2 Example Let $R$ be an ordered ring with set $P$ of positive elements. There are two natural ways to define an ordering of the polynomial ring $R[x]$. We describe two possible sets, $P_{\text {low }}$ and $P_{\text {high }}$, of positive elements. A nonzero polynomial in $R[x]$ can be written in the form

$$
f(x)=a_{r} x^{r}+a_{r+1} x^{r+1}+\cdots+a_{n} x^{n}
$$

where $a_{r} \neq 0$ and $a_{n} \neq 0$, so that $a_{r} x^{r}$ and $a_{n} x^{n}$ are the nonzero terms of lowest and highest degree, respectively. Let $P_{\text {low }}$ be the set of all such $f(x)$ for which $a_{r} \in P$, and let $P_{\text {high }}$ be the set of all such $f(x)$ for which $a_{n} \in P$. The closure and trichotomy requirements that $P_{\text {low }}$ and $P_{\text {high }}$ must satisfy to give orderings of $R[x]$ follow at once from those same properties for $P$ and the definition of addition and multiplication in $R[x]$. Illustrating in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$, with ordering given by $P_{\text {low }}$, the polynomial $f(x)=-2 x+3 x^{4}$ would not be positive because -2 is not positive in $\mathbb{Z}$. With ordering given by $P_{\mathrm{high}}$, this same polynomial would be positive because 3 is positive in $\mathbb{Z}$.

Suppose now that $P$ is the set of positive elements in an ordered ring $R$. Let $a$ be any nonzero element of $R$. Then either $a$ or $-a$ is in $P$, so by closure, $a^{2}=(-a)^{2}$ is also in $P$. Thus all squares of nonzero elements of $R$ are positive. In particular, $1=1^{2}$ is positive. By closure, we see that $1+1+\cdots+1$ for any finite number of summands is always in $P$, so it is never zero. Thus an ordered ring has characteristic zero.

Because squares of nonzero elements must be positive, we see that the natural ordering of $\mathbb{R}$ is the only possible ordering. The positive real numbers are precisely the squares of nonzero real numbers and the set could not be enlarged without destroying trichotomy. Because $1+1+\cdots+1$ must be positive, the only possible ordering of $\mathbb{Z}$ is the natural ordering also. All ordered rings have characteristic zero so we can, by identification (renaming), consider every ordered ring to contain $\mathbb{Z}$ as an ordered subring.

If $a$ and $b$ are nonzero elements of $P$ then either $-a$ or $a$ is in $P$ and either $-b$ or $b$ is in $P$. Consequently by closure, either $a b$ or $-a b$ is in $P$. By trichotomy, $a b$ cannot be zero so an ordered ring can have no zero divisors.

We summarize these observations in a theorem and corollary.

25.3 Theorem Let $R$ be an ordered ring. All squares of nonzero elements of $R$ are positive, $R$ has characteristic 0 , and there are no zero divisors.

25.4 Corollary We can consider $\mathbb{Z}$ to be embedded in any ordered ring $R$, and the induced ordering of $\mathbb{Z}$ from $R$ is the natural ordering of $\mathbb{Z}$. The only possible ordering of $\mathbb{R}$ is the natural ordering.

Theorem 25.3 shows that the field $\mathbb{C}$ of complex numbers cannot be ordered, because both $1=1^{2}$ and $-1=i^{2}$ are squares. It also shows that no finite ring can be ordered because the characteristic of an ordered ring is zero.

The theorem that follows defines a relation $<$ in an ordered ring, and gives properties of $<$. The definition of $<$ is motivated by the observation that, in the real numbers, $a<b$ if and only if $b-a$ is positive. The theorem also shows that ordering could have been defined in terms of a relation $<$ having the listed properties.

25.5 Theorem Let $R$ be an ordered ring with set $P$ of positive elements. Let $<$, read "is less than," be the relation on $R$ defined by

$$
a<b \text { if and only if }(b-a) \in P
$$

for $a, b \in R$. The relation $<$ has these properties for all $a, b, c \in R$.

Trichotomy One and only one of the following holds:

$$
a<b, \quad a=b, \quad b<a .
$$

Transitivity If $a<b$ and $b<c$, then $a<c$.

Isotonicity If $b<c$, then $a+b<a+c$.

$$
\text { If } b<c \text { and } 0<a \text {, then } a b<a c \text { and } b a<c a \text {. }
$$

Conversely, given a relation $<$ on a nonzero ring $R$ satisfying these three conditions, the set $P=\{x \in R \mid 0<x\}$ satisfies the two criteria for a set of positive elements in Definition 25.1, and the relation $<_{P}$ defined as in Condition (1) with this $P$ is the given relation $<$.

Proof Let $R$ be an ordered ring with set $P$ of positive elements, and let $a<b$ mean $(b-a) \in P$. We prove the three properties for $<$.

Trichotomy Let $a, b \in R$. By the trichotomy property of $P$ in Definition 25.1 applied to $b-a$, exactly one of

$$
(b-a) \in P, \quad b-a=0, \quad(a-b) \in P
$$

holds. These translate in terms of $<$ to

$$
a<b, \quad a=b, \quad b<a
$$

respectively.

Transitivity Let $a<b$ and $b<c$. Then $(b-a) \in P$ and $(c-b) \in P$. By closure of $P$ under addition, we have

$$
(b-a)+(c-b)=(c-a) \in P
$$

so $a<c$.

Isotonicity Let $b<c$, so $(c-b) \in P$. Then $(a+c)-(a+b)=(c-b) \in$ $P$ so $a+b<a+c$. Also if $a>0$, then by closure of $P$ both $a(c-b)=a c-a b$ and $(c-b) a=c a-b a$ are in $P$, so $a b<a c$ and $b a<c a$.

We leave the "conversely" part of the theorem as an equally easy exercise. (See Exercise 27.)

In view of Theorem 25.5, we will now feel free to use the $<$ notation in an ordered ring. The notations $>, \leq$, and $\geq$ are defined as usual in terms of $<$ and $=$. Namely,

$$
\begin{array}{r}
b>a \text { means } a<b, \quad a \leq b \text { means either } a=b \text { or } a<b, \\
a \geq b \text { means either } b<a \text { or } b=a .
\end{array}
$$

25.6 Example Let $R$ be an ordered ring. It is illustrative to think what the orderings of $R[x]$ given by $P_{\text {low }}$ and $P_{\text {high }}$ in Example 25.2 mean in terms of the relation $<$ of Theorem 25.5.

Taking $P_{\text {low }}$, we observe, for every $a>0$ in $R$, that $a-x$ is positive so $x<a$. Also, $x=x-0$ is positive, so $0<x$. Thus $0<x<a$ for every $a \in R$. We have $\left(x^{i}-x^{j}\right) \in$ $P_{\text {low }}$ when $i<j$, so $x^{j}<x^{i}$ if $i<j$. Our monomials have the ordering

$$
0<\cdots x^{6}<x^{5}<x^{4}<x^{3}<x^{2}<x<a
$$

for any positive $a \in R$. Taking $R=\mathbb{R}$, we see that in this ordering of $\mathbb{R}[x]$ there are infinitely many positive elements that are less than any positive real number!

We leave a similar discussion of $<$ for the ordering of $R[x]$ given by $P_{\text {high }}$ to Exercise 1.

The preceding example is of interest because it exhibits an ordering that is not Archimedian. We give a definition explaining this terminology. Remember that we can consider $\mathbb{Z}$ to be a subring of every ordered ring.

An ordering of a ring $R$ with this property:

For each given positive $a$ and $b$ in $R$, there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $n a>b$.

## is an Archimedian ordering.

The natural ordering of $\mathbb{R}$ is Archimedian, but the ordering of $\mathbb{R}[x]$ given by $P_{\text {low }}$ discussed in Example 25.6 is not Archimedian because for every positive integer $n$ we have $(17-n x) \in P_{\text {low }}$, so $n x<17$ for all $n \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}$.

We give two examples describing types of ordered rings and fields that are of interest in more advanced work.

25.8 Example (Formal Power Series Rings) Let $R$ be a ring. In Section 22 we defined a polynomial in $R[x]$ to be a formal sum $\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} a_{i} x^{i}$ where all but a finite number of the $a_{i}$ are 0 . If we do not require any of the $a_{i}$ to be zero, we obtain a formal power series in $x$ with coefficients in the ring $R$. (The adjective, formal, is customarily used because we are not dealing with convergence of series.) Exactly the same formulas are used to define the sum and product of these series as for polynomials in Section 22. Most of us had some
practice adding and multiplying series when we studied calculus. These series form a ring which we denote by $R[[x]]$, and which contains $R[x]$ as a subring.

If $R$ is an ordered ring, we can extend the ordering to $R[[x]]$ exactly as we extended the ordering to $R[x]$ using the set $P_{\text {low }}$ of positive elements. (We cannot use $P_{\text {high }}$. Why not?) The monomials have the same ordering that we displayed in Example 25.6.

25.9 Example (Formal Laurent Series Fields) Continuing with the idea of Example 25.8, we let $F$ be a field and consider formal series of the form $\sum_{i=N}^{\infty} a_{i} x^{i}$ where $N$ may be any integer, positive, zero, or negative, and $a_{i} \in F$. (Equivalently, we could consider $\sum_{i=-\infty}^{\infty} a_{i} x^{i}$ where all but a finite number of the $a_{i}$ are zero for negative values of $i$. In studying calculus for functions of a complex variable, one encounters series of this form called "Laurent series.") With the natural addition and multiplication of these series, we actually have a field which we denote by $F((x))$. The inverse of $x$ is the series $x^{-1}+0+0 x+0 x^{2}+\cdots$. Inverses of elements and quotients can be computed by series division. We compute three terms of $\left(x^{-1}-1+x-x^{2}+x^{3}+\cdots\right) /\left(x^{3}+2 x^{4}+3 x^{5}+\cdots\right)$ in $\mathbb{R}((x))$ for illustration.

If $F$ is an ordered field, we can use the obvious analog of $P_{\text {low }}$ in $R[[x]]$ to define an ordering of $F((x))$. In Exercise 2 we ask you to symbolically order the monomials $\cdots x^{-3}, x^{-2}, x^{-1}, x^{0}=1, x, x^{2}, x^{3}, \cdots$ as we did for $R[x]$ in Example 25.6. Note that $F((x))$ contains, as a subfield, a field of quotients of $F[x]$, and thus induces an ordering on this field of quotients.

Let $R$ be an ordered ring and let $\phi: R \rightarrow R^{\prime}$ be a ring isomorphism. It is intuitively clear that by identification (renaming), the map $\phi$ can be used to carry over the ordering of $R$ to provide an ordering of $R^{\prime}$. We state as a theorem what would have to be proved for a skeptic, and leave the proof as Exercise 25.

25.10 Theorem Let $R$ be an ordered ring with set $P$ of positive elements and let $\phi: R \rightarrow R^{\prime}$ be a ring isomorphism. The subset $P^{\prime}=\phi[P]$ satisfies the requirements of Definition 25.1 for a set of positive elements of $R^{\prime}$. Furthermore, in the ordering of $R^{\prime}$ given by $P^{\prime}$, we have $\phi(a)<^{\prime} \phi(b)$ in $R^{\prime}$ if and only if $a<b$ in $R$.

We call the ordering of $R^{\prime}$ described in the preceding theorem the "ordering induced by" $\phi$ from the ordering of $R$.

25.11 Example $\quad$ Example 22.9 stated that the evaluation homomorphism $\phi_{\pi}: \mathbb{Q}[x] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ where

$$
\phi\left(a_{0}+a_{1} x+\cdots+a_{n} x^{n}\right)=a_{0}+a_{1} \pi+\cdots+a_{n} \pi^{n}
$$

is one to one. Thus it provides an isomorphism of $\mathbb{Q}[x]$ with $\phi[\mathbb{Q}[x]]$. We denote this
image ring by $\mathbb{Q}[\pi]$. If we provide $\mathbb{Q}[x]$ with the ordering using the set $P_{\text {low }}$ of Examples 25.2 and 25.6 , the ordering on $\mathbb{Q}[\pi]$ induced by $\phi_{\pi}$ is very different from that induced by the natural (and only) ordering of $\mathbb{R}$. In the $P_{\text {low }}$ ordering, $\pi$ is less than any element of $\mathbb{Q}$ !

An isomorphism of a ring $R$ onto itself is called an automorphism of $R$. Theorem 25.10 can be used to exhibit different orderings of an ordered ring $R$ if there exist automorphisms of $R$ that do not carry the set $P$ of positive elements onto itself. We give an example.

25.12 Example Exercise 11 of Section 18 shows that $\{m+n \sqrt{2} \mid m, n \in \mathbb{Z}\}$ is a ring. Let us denote this ring by $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}]$. This ring has a natural order induced from $\mathbb{R}$ in which $\sqrt{2}$ is positive. However, we claim that $\phi: \mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}] \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}]$ defined by $\phi(m+n \sqrt{2})=m-n \sqrt{2}$ is an automorphism. It is clearly one to one and onto $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}]$. We leave the verification of the homomorphism property to Exercise 17. Because $\phi(\sqrt{2})=-\sqrt{2}$, we see the ordering induced by $\phi$ will be one where $-\sqrt{2}$ is positive! In the natural order on $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}]$, an element $m+n \sqrt{2}$ is positive if $m$ and $n$ are both positive, or if $m$ is positive and $2 n^{2}<m^{2}$, or if $n$ is positive and $m^{2}<2 n^{2}$. In Exercise 3, we ask you to give the analogous descriptions for positive elements in the ordering of $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}]$ induced by $\phi$.

In view of Examples 25.11 and 25.12, which exhibit orderings on subrings of $\mathbb{R}$ that are not the induced orderings, we wonder whether $\mathbb{Q}$ can have an ordering other than the natural one. Our final theorem shows that this is not possible.

25.13 Theorem Let $D$ be an ordered integral domain with $P$ as set of positive elements, and let $F$ be a field of quotients of $D$. The set

$$
P^{\prime}=\{x \in F \mid x=a / b \text { for } a, b \in D \text { and } a b \in P\}
$$

is well-defined and gives an order on $F$ that induces the given order on $D$. Furthermore, $P^{\prime}$ is the only subset of $F$ with this property.

Proof To show that $P^{\prime}$ is well-defined, suppose that $x=a / b=a^{\prime} / b^{\prime}$ for $a, b, a^{\prime}, b^{\prime} \in D$ and that $a b \in P$. We must show that $a^{\prime} b^{\prime} \in P$. From $a / b=a^{\prime} / b^{\prime}$ we obtain $a b^{\prime}=a^{\prime} b$. Multiplying by $b$, we have $(a b) b^{\prime}=a^{\prime} b^{2}$. Now $b^{2} \in P$ and by assumption, $a b \in P$. Using trichotomy and the properties $a(-b)=(-a) b=-(a b)$ of a ring, we see that either $a^{\prime}$ and $b^{\prime}$ are both in $P$ or both not in $P$. In either case, we have $a^{\prime} b^{\prime} \in P$.

We proceed to closure for $P^{\prime}$. Let $x=a / b$ and $y=c / d$ be two elements of $P^{\prime}$, so $a b \in P$ and $c d \in P$. Now $x+y=(a d+b c) / b d$ and $(a d+b c) b d=(a b) d^{2}+b^{2}(c d)$ is in $P$ because squares are also in $P$ and $P$ is closed under addition and multiplication. Thus $(x+y) \in P^{\prime}$. Also $x y=a c / b d$ is in $P^{\prime}$ because $a c b d=(a b)(c d)$ is a product of two elements of $P$ and thus in $P$.

For trichotomy, we need only observe that for $x=a / b$, the product $a b$ satisfies just one of

$$
a b \in P, \quad a b=0, \quad a b \notin P
$$

by trichotomy for $P$. For $P^{\prime}$, these translate into $x \in P^{\prime}, x=0$, and $x \notin P^{\prime}$, respectively.

We have shown that $P^{\prime}$ does give an ordering of $F$. For $a \in D$, we see that $a=a / 1$ is in $P^{\prime}$ if and only if $a 1=a$ is in $P$, so the given ordering on $D$ is indeed the induced ordering from $F$ by $P^{\prime}$.

Finally, suppose that $P^{\prime \prime}$ is a set of positive elements of $F$ satisfying the conditions of Definition 25.1 and such that $P^{\prime \prime} \cap D=P$. Let $x=a / b \in P^{\prime \prime}$ where $a, b \in D$. Then $x b^{2}=a b$ must be in $P^{\prime \prime}$, so $a b \in\left(P^{\prime \prime} \cap D\right)=P$. Thus $x \in P^{\prime}$ so $P^{\prime \prime} \subseteq P^{\prime}$. The law of trichotomy shows that we then must have $P^{\prime}=P^{\prime \prime}$. Therefore $P^{\prime}$ gives the only ordering of $F$ that maintains original order for elements of $D$.

## Concepts

14. It can be shown that the smallest subfield of $\mathbb{R}$ containing $\sqrt[3]{2}$ is isomorphic to the smallest subfield of $\mathbb{C}$ containing $\sqrt[3]{2}\left(\frac{-1+i \sqrt{3}}{2}\right)$.

15. Mark each of the following true or false.

a. There is only one ordering possible for the ring $\mathbb{Z}$.

d. The field $\mathbb{Q}$ can be ordered in only one way.

e. If $R$ is an ordered ring, then $R[x]$ can be ordered in a way that induces the given order on $R$.

f. An ordering of a ring $R$ is Archimedian if for each $a, b \in R$, there exists $n \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}$such that $b<n a$.

g. An ordering of a ring $R$ is Archimedian if for each $a, b \in R$ such that $0<a$, there exists $n \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}$ such that $b<n a$.

h. If $R$ is an ordered ring and $a \in R$, then $-a$ cannot be positive.

i. If $R$ is an ordered ring and $a \in R$, then either $a$ or $-a$ is positive.

j. Every ordered ring has an infinite number of elements.

16. Describe an ordering of the ring $\mathbb{Q}[\pi]$, discussed in Example 25.11 , in which $\pi$ is greater than any rational number.

## Theory

17. Referring to Example 25.12, show that the map $\phi: \mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ where $\phi(m+n \sqrt{2})=m-n \sqrt{2}$ is a homomorphism.

In Exercises 18 through 24, let $R$ be an ordered ring with set $P$ of positive elements, and let $<$ be the relation on $R$ defined in Theorem 25.5. Prove the given statement. (All the proofs have to be in terms of Definition 25.1 and Theorem 25.5. For example, you must not say, "We know that negative times positive is negative, so if $a<0$ and $0<b$ then $a b<0 . ")$

18. If $a \in P$, then $0<a$.
19. If $a, b \in P$ and $a c=b d$, then either $c=d=0$ or $c d \in P$.
20. If $a<b$, then $-b<-a$.
21. If $a<0$ and $0<b$, then $a b<0$.
22. If $R$ is a field and $a$ and $b$ are positive, then $a / b$ is positive.
23. If $R$ is a field and $0<a<1$, then $1<1 / a$.
24. If $R$ is a field and $-1<a<0$, then $1 / a<-1$.
25. Prove Theorem 25.10 of the text.
26. Show that if $R$ is an ordered ring with set $P$ of positive elements and $S$ is a subring of $R$, then $P \cap S$ satisfies the requirements for a set of positive elements in the ring $S$, and thus gives an ordering of $S$.
27. Show that if $<$ is a relation on a ring $R$ satisfying the properties of trichotomy, transitivity, and isotonicity stated in Theorem 25.5, then there exists a subset $P$ of $R$ satisfying the conditions for a set of positive elements
in Definition 25.1, and such that the relation $<_{P}$ defined by $a<_{P} b$ if and only if $(b-a) \in P$ is the same as the relation $<$.
28. Let $R$ be an ordered integral domain. Show that if $a^{2 n+1}=b^{2 n+1}$ where $a, b \in R$ and $n$ is a positive integer, then $a=b$.
29. Let $R$ be an ordered ring and consider the ring $R[x, y]$ of polynomials in two variables with coefficients in $R$. Example 25.2 describes two ways in which we can order $R[x]$, and for each of these, we can continue on and order $(R[x])[y]$ in the analogous two ways, giving four ways of arriving at an ordering of $R[x, y]$. There are another four ways of arriving at an ordering of $R[x, y]$ if we first order $R[y]$ and then $(R[y])[x]$. Show that all eight of these orderings of $R[x, y]$ are different. [Hint: You might start by considering whether $x<y$ or $y<x$ in each of these orderings, and continue in this fashion.]

Section 27 Prime and Maximal Ideals

## SECTION 26 HomomorPhiSMS AND FACTOR RingS

## Homomorphisms

We defined the concepts of homomorphism and isomorphism for rings in Section 18, since we wished to talk about evaluation homomorphisms for polynomials and about isomorphic rings. We repeat some definitions here for easy reference. Recall that a homomorphism is a structure-relating map. A homomorphism for rings must relate both their additive structure and their multiplicative structure.

26.1 Definition A map $\phi$ of a ring $R$ into a ring $R^{\prime}$ is a homomorphism if

$$
\phi(a+b)=\phi(a)+\phi(b)
$$

and

$$
\phi(a b)=\phi(a) \phi(b)
$$

for all elements $a$ and $b$ in $R$.

In Example 18.10 we defined evaluation homomorphisms, and Example 18.11 showed that the map $\phi: \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_{n}$, where $\phi(m)$ is the remainder of $m$ when divided by $n$, is a homomorphism. We give another simple but very fundamental example of a homomorphism.

26.2 Example (Projection Homomorphisms) Let $R_{1}, R_{2}, \cdots, R_{n}$ be rings. For each $i$, the map $\pi_{i}$ : $R_{1} \times R_{2} \times \cdots \times R_{n} \rightarrow R_{i}$ defined by $\pi_{i}\left(r_{1}, r_{2}, \cdots, r_{n}\right)=r_{i}$ is a homomorphism, projection onto the ith component. The two required properties of a homomorphism hold[^15]for $\pi_{i}$ since both addition and multiplication in the direct product are computed by addition and multiplication in each individual component.

## Properties of Homomorphisms

We work our way through the exposition of Section 13 but for ring homomorphisms.

26.3 Theorem (Analogue of Theorem 13.12) Let $\phi$ be a homomorphism of a ring $R$ into a ring $R^{\prime}$. If 0 is the additive identity in $R$, then $\phi(0)=0^{\prime}$ is the additive identity in $R^{\prime}$, and if $a \in R$, then $\phi(-a)=-\phi(a)$. If $S$ is a subring of $R$, then $\phi[S]$ is a subring of $R^{\prime}$. Going the other way, if $S^{\prime}$ is a subring of $R^{\prime}$, then $\phi^{-1}\left[S^{\prime}\right]$ is a subring of $R$. Finally, if $R$ has unity 1 , then $\phi(1)$ is unity for $\phi[R]$. Loosely speaking, subrings correspond to subrings, and rings with unity correspond to rings with unity under a ring homomorphism.

Proof Let $\phi$ be a homomorphism of a ring $R$ into a ring $R^{\prime}$. Since, in particular, $\phi$ can be viewed as a group homomorphism of $\langle R,+\rangle$ into $\left\langle R^{\prime},+^{\prime}\right\rangle$, Theorem 13.12 tells us that $\phi(0)=0^{\prime}$ is the additive identity element of $R^{\prime}$ and that $\phi(-a)=-\phi(a)$.

Theorem 13.12 also tells us that if $S$ is a subring of $R$, then, considering the additive group $\langle S,+\rangle$, the set $\left\langle\phi[S],+^{\prime}\right\rangle$ gives a subgroup of $\left\langle R^{\prime},+^{\prime}\right\rangle$. If $\phi\left(s_{1}\right)$ and $\phi\left(s_{2}\right)$ are two elements of $\phi[S]$, then

$$
\phi\left(s_{1}\right) \phi\left(s_{2}\right)=\phi\left(s_{1} s_{2}\right)
$$

and $\phi\left(s_{1} s_{2}\right) \in \phi[S]$. Thus $\phi\left(s_{1}\right) \phi\left(s_{2}\right) \in \phi[S]$, so $\phi[S]$ is closed under multiplication. Consequently, $\phi[S]$ is a subring of $R^{\prime}$.

Going the other way, Theorem 13.12 also shows that if $S^{\prime}$ is a subring of $R^{\prime}$, then $\left\langle\phi^{-1}\left[S^{\prime}\right],+\right\rangle$ is a subgroup of $\langle R,+\rangle$. Let $a, b \in \phi^{-1}\left[S^{\prime}\right]$, so that $\phi(a) \in S^{\prime}$ and $\phi(b) \in S^{\prime}$. Then

$$
\phi(a b)=\phi(a) \phi(b) .
$$

Since $\phi(a) \phi(b) \in S^{\prime}$, we see that $a b \in \phi^{-1}\left[S^{\prime}\right]$ so $\phi^{-1}\left[S^{\prime}\right]$ is closed under multiplication and thus is a subring of $R$.

Finally, if $R$ has unity 1 , then for all $r \in R$,

$$
\phi(r)=\phi(1 r)=\phi(r 1)=\phi(1) \phi(r)=\phi(r) \phi(1),
$$

so $\phi(1)$ is unity for $\phi[R]$.

Note in Theorem 26.3 that $\phi(1)$ is unity for $\phi[R]$, but not necessarily for $R^{\prime}$ as we ask you to illustrate in Exercise 9.

26.4 Definition Let a map $\phi: R \rightarrow R^{\prime}$ be a homomorphism of rings. The subring

$$
\phi^{-1}\left[0^{\prime}\right]=\left\{r \in R \mid \phi(r)=0^{\prime}\right\}
$$

is the $\operatorname{kernel}$ of $\phi$, denoted by $\operatorname{Ker}(\phi)$.

Now this $\operatorname{Ker}(\phi)$ is the same as the kernel of the group homomorphism of $\langle R,+\rangle$ into $\left\langle R^{\prime},+\right\rangle$ given by $\phi$. Theorem 13.15 and Corollary 13.18 on group homomorphisms give us at once analogous results for ring homomorphisms.

26.5 Theorem (Analogue of Theorem 13.15) Let $\phi: R \rightarrow R^{\prime}$ be a ring homomorphism, and let $H=\operatorname{Ker}(\phi)$. Let $a \in R$. Then $\phi^{-1}[\phi(a)]=a+H=H+a$, where $a+H=H+a$ is the coset containing $a$ of the commutative additive group $\langle H,+\rangle$.

26.6 Corollary (Analogue of Corollary 13.18) A ring homomorphism $\phi: R \rightarrow R^{\prime}$ is a one-to-one map if and only if $\operatorname{Ker}(\phi)=\{0\}$.

## Factor (Quotient) Rings

We are now ready to describe the analogue for rings of Section 14. We start with the analogue of Theorem 14.1.

26.7 Theorem (Analogue of Theorem 14.1) Let $\phi: R \rightarrow R^{\prime}$ be a ring homomorphism with kernel $H$. Then the additive cosets of $H$ form a ring $R / H$ whose binary operations are defined by choosing representatives. That is, the sum of two cosets is defined by

$$
(a+H)+(b+H)=(a+b)+H,
$$

and the product of the cosets is defined by

$$
(a+H)(b+H)=(a b)+H .
$$

Also, the map $\mu: R / H \rightarrow \phi[R]$ defined by $\mu(a+H)=\phi(a)$ is an isomorphism.

Proof Once again, the additive part of the theory is done for us in Theorem 14.1. We proceed to check the multiplicative aspects.

We must first show that multiplication of cosets by choosing representatives is well defined. To this end, let $h_{1}, h_{2}, \in H$ and consider the representatives $a+h_{1}$ of $a+H$ and $b+h_{2}$ of $b+H$. Let

$$
c=\left(a+h_{1}\right)\left(b+h_{2}\right)=a b+a h_{2}+h_{1} b+h_{1} h_{2} .
$$

We must show that this element $c$ lies in the coset $a b+H$. Since $a b+H=\phi^{-1}[\phi(a b)]$, we need only show that $\phi(c)=\phi(a b)$. Since $\phi$ is a homomorphism and $\phi(h)=0^{\prime}$ for $h \in H$, we obtain

$$
\begin{aligned}
\phi(c) & =\phi\left(a b+a h_{2}+h_{1} b+h_{1} h_{2}\right) \\
& =\phi(a b)+\phi\left(a h_{2}\right)+\phi\left(h_{1} b\right)+\phi\left(h_{1} h_{2}\right) \\
& =\phi(a b)+\phi(a) 0^{\prime}+0^{\prime} \phi(b)+0^{\prime} 0^{\prime} \\
& =\phi(a b)+0^{\prime}+0^{\prime}+0^{\prime}=\phi(a b)
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus multiplication by choosing representatives is well defined.

To show that $R / H$ is a ring, it remains to show that the associative property for multiplication and the distributive laws hold in $R / H$. Since addition and multiplication are computed by choosing representatives, these properties follow at once from corresponding properties in $R$.

Theorem 14.1 shows that the map $\mu$ defined in the statement of Theorem 26.7 is well defined, one to one, onto $\phi[R]$, and satisfies the additive property for a homomorphism.

Multiplicatively, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mu((a+H)(b+H)) & =\mu(a b+H)=\phi(a b) \\
& =\phi(a) \phi(b)=\mu(a+H) \mu(b+H) .
\end{aligned}
$$

This completes the demonstration that $\mu$ is an isomorphism.

26.8 Example Example 18.11 shows that the map $\phi: \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_{n}$ defined by $\phi(m)=r$, where $r$ is the remainder of $m$ when divided by $n$, is a homomorphism. Since $\operatorname{Ker}(\phi)=n \mathbb{Z}$, Theorem 26.7 shows that $\mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z}$ is a ring where operations on residue classes can be computed by choosing representatives and performing the corresponding operation in $\mathbb{Z}$. The theorem also shows that this ring $\mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z}$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$.

It remains only to characterize those subrings $H$ of a ring $R$ such that multiplication of additive cosets of $H$ by choosing representatives is well defined. The coset multiplication in Theorem 26.7 was shown to be well defined in Eq. (1). The success of Eq. (1) is due to the fact that $\phi\left(a h_{2}\right)=\phi\left(h_{1} b\right)=\phi\left(h_{1} h_{2}\right)=0^{\prime}$. That is, if $h \in H$ where $H=\operatorname{Ker}(\phi)$, then for every $a, b \in R$ we have $a h \in H$ and $h b \in H$. This suggests Theorem 26.9 below, which is the analogue of Theorem 14.4.

26.9 Theorem (Analogue of Theorem 14.4) Let $H$ be a subring of the ring $R$. Multiplication of additive cosets of $H$ is well defined by the equation

$$
(a+H)(b+H)=a b+H
$$

if and only if $a h \in H$ and $h b \in H$ for all $a, b \in R$ and $h \in H$.

Proof Suppose first that $a h \in H$ and $h b \in H$ for all $a, b \in R$ and all $h \in H$. Let $h_{1}, h_{2} \in H$ so that $a+h_{1}$ and $b+h_{2}$ are also representatives of the cosets $a+H$ and $b+H$ containing $a$ and $b$. Then

$$
\left(a+h_{1}\right)\left(b+h_{2}\right)=a b+a h_{2}+h_{1} b+h_{1} h_{2} .
$$

Since $a h_{2}$ and $h_{1} b$ and $h_{1} h_{2}$ are all in $H$ by hypothesis, we see that $\left(a+h_{1}\right)\left(b+h_{2}\right) \in$ $a b+H$.

Conversely, suppose that multiplication of additive cosets by representatives is well defined. Let $a \in R$ and consider the coset product $(a+H) H$. Choosing representatives $a \in(a+H)$ and $0 \in H$, we see that $(a+H) H=a 0+H=0+H=H$. Since we can also compute $(a+H) H$ by choosing $a \in(a+H)$ and any $h \in H$, we see that $a h \in H$ for any $h \in H$. A similar argument starting with the product $H(b+H)$ shows that $h b \in H$ for any $h \in H$.

In group theory, normal subgroups are precisely the type of substructure of groups required to form a factor group with a well-defined operation on cosets given by operating with chosen representatives. Theorem 26.9 shows that in ring theory, the analogous substructure must be a subring $H$ of a ring $R$ such that $a H \subseteq H$ and $H b \subseteq H$ for all $a, b \in R$, where $a H=\{a h \mid h \in H\}$ and $H b=\{h b \mid h \in H\}$. From now on we will usually denote such a substructure by $N$ rather than $H$. Recall that we started using $N$ to mean a normal subgroup in Section 15.

26.10 Definition An addative subgroup $N$ of a ring $R$ satisfying the properties

$$
a N \subseteq N \quad \text { and } \quad N b \subseteq N \quad \text { for all } a, b \in R
$$

is an ideal.

26.11 Example We see that $n \mathbb{Z}$ is an ideal in the ring $\mathbb{Z}$ since we know it is a subring, and $s(n m)=$ $(n m) s=n(m s) \in n \mathbb{Z}$ for all $s \in \mathbb{Z}$.

26.12 Example Let $F$ be the ring of all functions mapping $\mathbb{R}$ into $\mathbb{R}$, and let $C$ be the subring of $F$ consisting of all the constant functions in $F$. Is $C$ an ideal in $F$ ? Why?

Solution It is not true that the product of a constant function with every function is again a constant function. For example, the product of $\sin x$ and 2 is the function $2 \sin x$. Thus $C$ is not an ideal of $F$.

## Historical Note

Tt was Ernst Eduard Kummer (1810-1893) who

introduced the concept of an "ideal complex number" in 1847 in order to preserve the notion of unique factorization in certain rings of algebraic integers. In particular, Kummer wanted to be able to factor into primes numbers of the form $a_{0}+a_{1} \alpha+a_{2} \alpha^{2}+\cdots+a_{p-1} \alpha^{p-1}$, where $\alpha$ is a complex root of $x^{p}=1$ ( $p$ prime) and the $a_{i}$ are ordinary integers. Kummer had noticed that the naive definition of primes as "unfactorable numbers" does not lead to the expected results; the product of two such "unfactorable" numbers may well be divisible by other "unfactorable" numbers. Kummer defined "ideal prime factors" and "ideal numbers" in terms of certain congruence relationships; these "ideal factors" were then used as the divisors necessary to preserve unique factorization. By use of these, Kummer was in fact able to prove certain cases of Fermat's Last Theorem, which states that $x^{n}+y^{n}=z^{n}$ has no solutions $x, y, z \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}$if $n>2$.

It turned out that an "ideal number," which was in general not a "number" at all, was uniquely determined by the set of integers it "divided." Richard Dedekind took advantage of this fact to identify the ideal factor with this set; he therefore called the set itself an ideal, and proceeded to show that it satisfied the definition given in the text. Dedekind was then able to define the notions of prime ideal and product of two ideals and show that any ideal in the ring of integers of any algebraic number field could be written uniquely as a product of prime ideals.

26.13 Example Let $F$ be as in the preceding example, and let $N$ be the subring of all functions $f$ such that $f(2)=0$. Is $N$ an ideal in $F$ ? Why or why not?

Solution Let $f \in N$ and let $g \in F$. Then $(f g)(2)=f(2) g(2)=0 g(2)=0$, so $f g \in N$. Similarly, we find that $g f \in N$. Therefore $N$ is an ideal of $F$. We could also have proved this by just observing that $N$ is the kernel of the evaluation homomorphism $\phi_{2}: F \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$.

Once we know that multiplication by choosing representatives is well defined on additive cosets of a subring $N$ of $R$, the associative law for multiplication and the distributive laws for these cosets follow at once from the same properties in $R$. We have at once this corollary of Theorem 26.9 .

26.14 Corollary (Analogue of Corollary 14.5) Let $N$ be an ideal of a ring $R$. Then the additive cosets of $N$ form a ring $R / N$ with the binary operations defined by

$$
(a+N)+(b+N)=(a+b)+N
$$

and

$$
(a+N)(b+N)=a b+N .
$$

26.15 Definition The ring $R / N$ in the preceding corollary is the factor ring (or quotient ring) of $R$ by $N$.

If we use the term quotient ring, be sure not to confuse it with the notion of the field of quotients of an integral domain, discussed in Section 21.

## Fundamental Homomorphism Theorem

To complete our analogy with Sections 13 and 14, we give the analogues of Theorems 14.9 and 14.11.

26.16 Theorem (Analogue of Theorem 14.9) Let $N$ be an ideal of a ring $R$. Then $\gamma: R \rightarrow R / N$ given by $\gamma(x)=x+N$ is a ring homomorphism with kernel $N$.

Proof The additive part is done in Theorem 14.9. Turning to the multiplicative question, we see that

$$
\gamma(x y)=(x y)+N=(x+N)(y+N)=\gamma(x) \gamma(y) .
$$

26.17 Theorem (Fundamental Homomorphism Theorem; Analogue of Theorem 14.11) Let $\phi$ : $R \rightarrow R^{\prime}$ be a ring homomorphism with kernel $N$. Then $\phi[R]$ is a ring, and the map $\mu: R / N \rightarrow \phi[R]$ given by $\mu(x+N)=\phi(x)$ is an isomorphism. If $\gamma: R \rightarrow R / N$ is the homomorphism given by $\gamma(x)=x+N$, then for each $x \in R$, we have $\phi(x)=\mu \gamma(x)$.

Proof This follows at once from Theorems 26.7 and 26.16. Figure 26.18 is the analogue of Fig. 14.10.

26.18 Figure

26.19 Example Example 26.11 shows that $n \mathbb{Z}$ is an ideal of $\mathbb{Z}$, so we can form the factor ring $\mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z}$. Example 18.11 shows that $\phi: \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_{n}$ where $\phi(m)$ is the remainder of $m$ modulo $n$ is a homomorphism, and we see that $\operatorname{Ker}(\phi)=n \mathbb{Z}$. Theorem 26.17 then shows that the map $\mu: \mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_{n}$ where $\mu(m+n \mathbb{Z})$ is the remainder of $m$ modulo $n$ is well defined and is an isomorphism.

In summary, every ring homomorphism with domain $R$ gives rise to a factor ring $R / N$, and every factor ring $R / N$ gives rise to a homomorphism mapping $R$ into $R / N$. An ideal in ring theory is analogous to a normal subgroup in the group theory. Both are the type of substructure needed to form a factor structure.

We should now add an addendum to Theorem 26.3 on properties of homomorphisms. Let $\phi: R \rightarrow R^{\prime}$ be a homomorphism, and let $N$ be an ideal of $R$. Then $\phi[N]$ is an ideal of $\phi[R]$, although it need not be an ideal of $R^{\prime}$. Also, if $N^{\prime}$ is an ideal of either $\phi[R]$ or of $R^{\prime}$, then $\phi^{-1}\left[N^{\prime}\right]$ is an ideal of $R$. We leave the proof of this to Exercise 22.

## EXERCISES 26

## Computations

1. Describe all ring homomorphisms of $\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}$ into $\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}$. [Hint: Note that if $\phi$ is such a homomorphism, then $\phi((1,0))=\phi((1,0)) \phi((1,0))$ and $\phi((0,1))=\phi((0,1)) \phi((0,1))$. Consider also $\phi((1,0)(0,1))$.]

## Section 27 Prime and Maximal Ideals

Exercises 12 through 14 of the preceding section asked us to provide examples of factor rings $R / N$ where $R$ and $R / N$ have very different structural properties. We start with some examples of this situation, and in the process, provide solutions to those exercises.

27.1 Example As was shown in Corollary 19.12 , the ring $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$, which is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z} / p \mathbb{Z}$, is a field for $p$ a prime. Thus a factor ring of an integral domain may be a field.

27.2 Example The ring $\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}$ is not an integral domain, for

$$
(0,1)(1,0)=(0,0)
$$

showing that $(0,1)$ and $(1,0)$ are 0 divisors. Let $N=\{(0, n) \mid n \in \mathbb{Z}\}$. Now $N$ is an ideal of $\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}$, and $(\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}) / N$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}$ under the correspondence $[(m, 0)+N] \leftrightarrow m$, where $m \in \mathbb{Z}$. Thus a factor ring of a ring may be an integral domain, even though the original ring is not.

27.3 Example The subset $N=\{0,3\}$ of $\mathbb{Z}_{6}$ is easily seen to be an ideal of $\mathbb{Z}_{6}$, and $\mathbb{Z}_{6} / N$ has three elements, $0+N, 1+N$, and $2+N$. These add and multiply in such a fashion as to show that $\mathbb{Z}_{6} / N \simeq \mathbb{Z}_{3}$ under the correspondence

$$
(0+N) \leftrightarrow 0, \quad(1+N) \leftrightarrow 1, \quad(2+N) \leftrightarrow 2 .
$$

This example shows that if $R$ is not even an integral domain, that is, if $R$ has zero divisors, it is still possible for $R / N$ to be a field.

27.4 Example Note that $\mathbb{Z}$ is an integral domain, but $\mathbb{Z} / 6 \mathbb{Z} \simeq \mathbb{Z}_{6}$ is not. The preceding examples showed that a factor ring may have a structure that seems better than the original ring. This example indicates that the structure of a factor ring may seem worse than that of the original ring.

Every nonzero ring $R$ has at least two ideals, the improper ideal $R$ and the trivial ideal $\{0\}$. For these ideals, the factor rings are $R / R$, which has only one element, and $R /\{0\}$, which is isomorphic to $R$. These are uninteresting cases. Just as for a subgroup of a group, a proper nontrivial ideal of a ring $R$ is an ideal $N$ of $R$ such that $N \neq R$ and $N \neq\{0\}$.

While factor rings of rings and integral domains may be of great interest, as the above examples indicate, Corollary 27.6, which follows our next theorem, shows that a factor ring of a field is really not useful to us.

27.5 Theorem If $R$ is a ring with unity, and $N$ is an ideal of $R$ containing a unit, then $N=R$.

Proof Let $N$ be an ideal of $R$, and suppose that $u \in N$ for some unit $u$ in $R$. Then the condition $r N \subseteq N$ for all $r \in R$ implies, if we take $r=u^{-1}$ and $u \in N$, that $1=u^{-1} u$ is in $N$. But then $r N \subseteq N$ for all $r \in R$ implies that $r 1=r$ is in $N$ for all $r \in R$, so $N=R$.

27.6 Corollary A field contains no proper nontrivial ideals.

Proof Since every nonzero element of a field is a unit, it follows at once from Theorem 27.5 that an ideal of a field $F$ is either $\{0\}$ or all of $F$.

## Maximal and Prime Ideals

We now take up the question of when a factor ring is a field and when it is an integral domain. The analogy with groups in Section 15 can be stretched a bit further to cover the case in which the factor ring is a field.

27.7 Definition A maximal ideal of a ring $R$ is an ideal $M$ different from $R$ such that there is no proper ideal $N$ of $R$ properly containing $M$.

27.8 Example Let $p$ be a prime positive integer. We know that $\mathbb{Z} / p \mathbb{Z}$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$. Forgetting about multiplication for the moment and regarding $\mathbb{Z} / p \mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ as additive groups, we know that $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ is a simple group, and consequently $p \mathbb{Z}$ must be a maximal normal subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}$ by Theorem 15.18 . Since $\mathbb{Z}$ is an abelian group and every subgroup is a normal subgroup, we see that $p \mathbb{Z}$ is a maximal proper subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}$. Since $p \mathbb{Z}$ is an ideal of the ring $\mathbb{Z}$, it follows that $p \mathbb{Z}$ is a maximal ideal of $\mathbb{Z}$. We know that $\mathbb{Z} / p \mathbb{Z}$ is isomorphic to the ring $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$, and that $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ is actually a field. Thus $\mathbb{Z} / p \mathbb{Z}$ is a field. This illustrates the next theorem.

27.9 Theorem (Analogue of Theorem 15.18) Let $R$ be a commutative ring with unity. Then $M$ is a maximal ideal of $R$ if and only if $R / M$ is a field.

Proof Suppose $M$ is a maximal ideal in $R$. Observe that if $R$ is a commutative ring with unity, then $R / M$ is also a nonzero commutative ring with unity if $M \neq R$, which is the case if $M$ is maximal. Let $(a+M) \in R / M$, with $a \notin M$, so that $a+M$ is not the additive identity element of $R / M$. Suppose $a+M$ has no multiplicative inverse in $R / M$. Then the set $(R / M)(a+M)=\{(r+M)(a+M) \mid(r+M) \in R / M\}$ does not contain $1+M$. We easily see that $(R / M)(a+M)$ is an ideal of $R / M$. It is nontrivial because $a \notin M$, and it is a proper ideal because it does not contain $1+M$. By the final paragraph of Section 26, if $\gamma: R \rightarrow R / M$ is the canonical homomorphism, then $\gamma^{-1}[(R / M)(a+M)]$ is a proper ideal of $R$ properly containing $M$. But this contradicts our assumption that $M$ is a maximal ideal, so $a+M$ must have a multiplicative inverse in $R / M$.

Conversely, suppose that $R / M$ is a field. By the final paragraph of Section 26, if $N$ is any ideal of $R$ such that $M \subset N \subset R$ and $\gamma$ is the canonical homomorphism of $R$ onto $R / M$, then $\gamma[N]$ is an ideal of $R / M$ with $\{(0+M)\} \subset \gamma[N] \subset R / M$. But this is contrary to Corollary 27.6, which states that the field $R / M$ contains no proper nontrivial ideals. Hence if $R / M$ is a field, $M$ is maximal.

27.10 Example Since $\mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z}$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ is a field if and only if $n$ is a prime, we see that the maximal ideals of $\mathbb{Z}$ are precisely the ideals $p \mathbb{Z}$ for prime positive integers $p$.

27.11 Corollary A commutative ring with unity is a field if and only if it has no proper nontrivial ideals.

Proof Corollary 27.6 shows that a field has no proper nontrivial ideals.

Conversely, if a commutative ring $R$ with unity has no proper nontrivial ideals, then $\{0\}$ is a maximal ideal and $R /\{0\}$, which is isomorphic to $R$, is a field by Theorem 27.9.

We now turn to the question of characterizing, for a commutative ring $R$ with unity, the ideals $N \neq R$ such that $R / N$ is an integral domain. The answer here is rather obvious. The factor ring $R / N$ will be an integral domain if and only if $(a+N)(b+N)=N$ implies that either

$$
a+N=N \quad \text { or } \quad b+N=N \text {. }
$$

This is exactly the statement that $R / N$ has no divisors of 0 , since the coset $N$ plays the role of 0 in $R / N$. Looking at representatives, we see that this condition amounts to saying that $a b \in N$ implies that either $a \in N$ or $b \in N$.

27.12 Example All ideals of $\mathbb{Z}$ are of the form $n \mathbb{Z}$. For $n=0$, we have $n \mathbb{Z}=\{0\}$, and $\mathbb{Z} /\{0\} \simeq \mathbb{Z}$, which is an integral domain. For $n>0$, we have $\mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z} \simeq \mathbb{Z}_{n}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ is an integral domain if and only if $n$ is a prime. Thus the nonzero ideals $n \mathbb{Z}$ such that $\mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z}$ is an integral domain are of the form $p \mathbb{Z}$, where $p$ is a prime. Of course, $\mathbb{Z} / p \mathbb{Z}$ is actually a field, so that $p \mathbb{Z}$ is a maximal ideal of $\mathbb{Z}$. Note that for a product $r s$ of integers to be in $p \mathbb{Z}$, the prime $p$ must divide either $r$ or $s$. The role of prime integers in this example makes the use of the word prime in the next definition more reasonable.

27.13 Definition An ideal $N \neq R$ in a commutative ring $R$ is a prime ideal if $a b \in N$ implies that either $a \in N$ or $b \in N$ for $a, b \in R$.

Note that $\{0\}$ is a prime ideal in $\mathbb{Z}$, and indeed, in any integral domain.

27.14 Example Note that $\mathbb{Z} \times\{0\}$ is a prime ideal of $\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}$, for if $(a, b)(c, d) \in \mathbb{Z} \times\{0\}$, then we must have $b d=0$ in $\mathbb{Z}$. This implies that either $b=0$ so $(a, b) \in \mathbb{Z} \times\{0\}$ or $d=0$ so $(c, d) \in$ $\mathbb{Z} \times\{0\}$. Note that $(\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}) /(\mathbb{Z} \times\{0\})$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}$, which is an integral domain.

Our remarks preceding Example 27.12 constitute a proof of the following theorem, which is illustrated by Example 27.14.

27.15 Theorem Let $R$ be a commutative ring with unity, and let $N \neq R$ be an ideal in $R$. Then $R / N$ is an integral domain if and only if $N$ is a prime ideal in $R$.

27.16 Corollary Every maximal ideal in a commutative ring $R$ with unity is a prime ideal.

Proof If $M$ is maximal in $R$, then $R / M$ is a field, hence an integral domain, and therefore $M$ is a prime ideal by Theorem 27.15.

The material that has just been presented regarding maximal and prime ideals is very important and we shall be using it quite a lot. We should keep the main ideas well in mind. We must know and understand the definitions of maximal and prime ideals and must remember the following facts that we have demonstrated.

For a commutative ring $R$ with unity:

1. An ideal $M$ of $R$ is maximal if and only if $R / M$ is a field.
2. An ideal $N$ of $R$ is prime if and only if $R / N$ is an integral domain.
3. Every maximal ideal of $R$ is a prime ideal.

## Prime Fields

We now proceed to show that the rings $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ form foundations upon which all rings with unity rest, and that $\mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ perform a similar service for all fields. Let $R$ be any ring with unity 1 . Recall that by $n \cdot 1$ we mean $1+1+\cdots+1$ for $n$ summands for $n>0$, and $(-1)+(-1)+\cdots+(-1)$ for $|n|$ summands for $n<0$, while $n \cdot 1=0$ for $n=0$.

27.17 Theorem If $R$ is a ring with unity 1 , then the map $\phi: \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow R$ given by

$$
\phi(n)=n \cdot 1
$$

for $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ is a homomorphism of $\mathbb{Z}$ into $R$.

Proof Observe that

$$
\phi(n+m)=(n+m) \cdot 1=(n \cdot 1)+(m \cdot 1)=\phi(n)+\phi(m) .
$$

The distributive laws in $R$ show that

$$
\underbrace{(1+1+\cdots+1)}_{n \text { summands }} \underbrace{(1+1+\cdots+1)}_{m \text { summands }}=\underbrace{(1+1+\cdots+1)}_{n m \text { summands }}
$$

Thus $(n \cdot 1)(m \cdot 1)=(n m) \cdot 1$ for $n, m>0$. Similar arguments with the distributive laws show that for all $n, m \in \mathbb{Z}$, we have

$$
(n \cdot 1)(m \cdot 1)=(n m) \cdot 1 .
$$

Thus

$$
\phi(n m)=(n m) \cdot 1=(n \cdot 1)(m \cdot 1)=\phi(n) \phi(m) .
$$

27.18 Corollary If $R$ is a ring with unity and characteristic $n>1$, then $R$ contains a subring isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$. If $R$ has characteristic 0 , then $R$ contains a subring isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}$.

Proof The map $\phi: \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow R$ given by $\phi(m)=m \cdot 1$ for $m \in \mathbb{Z}$ is a homomorphism by Theorem 27.17. The kernel must be an ideal in $\mathbb{Z}$. All ideals in $\mathbb{Z}$ are of the form $s \mathbb{Z}$ for some $s \in \mathbb{Z}$. By Theorem 19.15 we see that if $R$ has characteristic $n>0$, then the kernel of $\phi$ is $n \mathbb{Z}$. Then the image $\phi[\mathbb{Z}] \leq R$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z} \simeq \mathbb{Z}_{n}$. If the characteristic of $R$ is 0 , then $m \cdot 1 \neq 0$ for all $m \neq 0$, so the kernel of $\phi$ is $\{0\}$. Thus, the image $\phi[\mathbb{Z}] \leq R$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}$.

27.19 Theorem A field $F$ is either of prime characteristic $p$ and contains a subfield isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ or of characteristic 0 and contains a subfield isomorphic to $\mathbb{Q}$.

Proof If the characteristic of $F$ is not 0 , the above corollary shows that $F$ contains a subring isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$. Then $n$ must be a prime $p$, or $F$ would have 0 divisors. If $F$ is of characteristic 0 , then $F$ must contain a subring isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}$. In this case Corollaries

21.8 and 21.9 show that $F$ must contain a field of quotients of this subring and that this field of quotients must be isomorphic to $\mathbb{Q}$.

Thus every field contains either a subfield isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ for some prime $p$ or a subfield isomorphic to $\mathbb{Q}$. These fields $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ and $\mathbb{Q}$ are the fundamental building blocks on which all fields rest.

27.20 Definition The fields $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ and $\mathbb{Q}$ are prime fields.

## Ideal Structure in $F[x]$

Throughout the rest of this section, we assume that $F$ is a field. We give the next definition for a general commutative ring $R$ with unity, although we are only interested in the case $R=F[x]$. Note that for a commutative ring $R$ with unity and $a \in R$, the set $\{r a \mid r \in R\}$ is an ideal in $R$ that contains the element $a$.

27.21 Definition If $R$ is a commutative ring with unity and $a \in R$, the ideal $\{r a \mid r \in R\}$ of all multiples of $a$ is the principal ideal generated by $a$ and is denoted by $\langle a\rangle$. An ideal $N$ of $R$ is a principal ideal if $N=\langle a\rangle$ for some $a \in R$.

27.22 Example Every ideal of the ring $\mathbb{Z}$ is of the form $n \mathbb{Z}$, which is generated by $n$, so every ideal of $\mathbb{Z}$ is a principal ideal.

27.23 Example The ideal $\langle x\rangle$ in $F[x]$ consists of all polynomials in $F[x]$ having zero constant term.

The next theorem is another simple but very important application of the division algorithm for $F[x]$. (See Theorem 23.1.) The proof of this theorem is to the division algorithm in $F[x]$ as the proof that a subgroup of a cyclic group is cyclic is to the division algorithm in $\mathbb{Z}$.

27.24 Theorem If $F$ is a field, every ideal in $F[x]$ is principal.

Proof Let $N$ be an ideal of $F[x]$. If $N=\{0\}$, then $N=\langle 0\rangle$. Suppose that $N \neq\{0\}$, and let $g(x)$ be a nonzero element of $N$ of minimal degree. If the degree of $g(x)$ is 0 , then $g(x) \in F$ and is a unit, so $N=F[x]=\langle 1\rangle$ by Theorem 27.5, so $N$ is principal. If the degree of $g(x)$ is $\geq 1$, let $f(x)$ be any element of $N$. Then by Theorem 23.1, $f(x)=g(x) q(x)+r(x)$, where $r(x)=0$ or (degree $r(x))<($ degree $g(x))$. Now $f(x) \in N$ and $g(x) \in N$ imply that $f(x)-g(x) q(x)=r(x)$ is in $N$ by definition of an ideal. Since $g(x)$ is a nonzero element of minimal degree in $N$, we must have $r(x)=0$. Thus $f(x)=g(x) q(x)$ and $N=\langle g(x)\rangle$.

We can now characterize the maximal ideals of $F[x]$. This is a crucial step in achieving our basic goal: to show that any nonconstant polynomial $f(x)$ in $F[x]$ has a zero in some field $E$ containing $F$.

27.25 Theorem An ideal $\langle p(x)\rangle \neq\{0\}$ of $F[x]$ is maximal if and only if $p(x)$ is irreducible over $F$.

Proof Suppose that $\langle p(x)\rangle \neq\{0\}$ is a maximal ideal of $F[x]$. Then $\langle p(x)\rangle \neq F[x]$, so $p(x) \notin F$. Let $p(x)=f(x) g(x)$ be a factorization of $p(x)$ in $F[x]$. Since $\langle p(x)\rangle$ is a maximal ideal and hence also a prime ideal, $(f(x) g(x)) \in\langle p(x)\rangle$ implies that $f(x) \in\langle p(x)\rangle$ or $g(x) \in\langle p(x)\rangle$; that is, either $f(x)$ or $g(x)$ has $p(x)$ as a factor. But then we can't have the degrees of both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ less than the degree of $p(x)$. This shows that $p(x)$ is irreducible over $F$.

Conversely, if $p(x)$ is irreducible over $F$, suppose that $N$ is an ideal such that $\langle p(x)\rangle \subseteq N \subseteq F[x]$. Now $N$ is a principal ideal by Theorem 27.24 , so $N=\langle g(x)\rangle$ for some $g(x) \in N$. Then $p(x) \in N$ implies that $p(x)=g(x) q(x)$ for some $q(x) \in F[x]$. But $p(x)$ is irreducible, which implies that either $g(x)$ or $q(x)$ is of degree 0 . If $g(x)$ is of degree 0 , that is, a nonzero constant in $F$, then $g(x)$ is a unit in $F[x]$, so $\langle g(x)\rangle=N=F[x]$. If $q(x)$ is of degree 0 , then $q(x)=c$, where $c \in F$, and $g(x)=(1 / c) p(x)$ is in $\langle p(x)\rangle$, so $N=\langle p(x)\rangle$. Thus $\langle p(x)\rangle \subset N \subset F[x]$ is impossible, so $\langle p(x)\rangle$ is maximal.

27.26 Example Example 23.9 shows that $x^{3}+3 x+2$ is irreducible in $\mathbb{Z}_{5}[x]$, so $\mathbb{Z}_{5}[x] /\left\langle x^{3}+3 x+2\right\rangle$ is a field. Similarly, Theorem 22.11 shows that $x^{2}-2$ is irreducible in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$, so $\mathbb{Q}[x] /$ $\left\langle x^{2}-2\right\rangle$ is a field. We shall examine such fields in more detail later.

## Application to Unique Factorization in $F[x]$

In Section 23, we stated without proof Theorem 27.27, which follows. (See Theorem 23.18.) Assuming this theorem, we proved in Section 23 that factorization of polynomials in $F[x]$ into irreducible polynomials is unique, except for order of factors and units in $F$. We delayed the proof of Theorem 27.27 until now since the machinery we have developed enables us to give such a simple, four-line proof. This proof fills the gap in our proof of unique factorization in $F[x]$.

27.27 Theorem Let $p(x)$ be an irreducible polynomial in $F[x]$. If $p(x)$ divides $r(x) s(x)$ for $r(x), s(x) \in$ $F[x]$, then either $p(x)$ divides $r(x)$ or $p(x)$ divides $s(x)$.

Proof Suppose $p(x)$ divides $r(x) s(x)$. Then $r(x) s(x) \in\langle p(x)\rangle$, which is maximal by Theorem 27.25. Therefore, $\langle p(x)\rangle$ is a prime ideal by Corollary 27.16. Hence $r(x) s(x) \in$ $\langle p(x)\rangle$ implies that either $r(x) \in\langle p(x)\rangle$, giving $p(x)$ divides $r(x)$, or that $s(x) \in\langle p(x)\rangle$, giving $p(x)$ divides $s(x)$.

## A Preview of Our Basic Goal

We close this section with an outline of the demonstration in Section 29 of our basic goal. We have all the ideas for the proof at hand now; perhaps you can fill in the details from this outline.

Basic goal: Let $F$ be a field and let $f(x)$ be a nonconstant polynomial in $F[x]$. Show that there exists a field $E$ containing $F$ and containing a zero $\alpha$ of $f(x)$.

## Outline of the Proof

1. Let $p(x)$ be an irreducible factor of $f(x)$ in $F[x]$.
2. Let $E$ be the field $F[x] /\langle p(x)\rangle$. (See Theorems 27.25 and 27.9.)
3. Show that no two different elements of $F$ are in the same coset of $F[x] /\langle p(x)\rangle$, and deduce that we may consider $F$ to be (isomorphic to) a subfield of $E$.
4. Let $\alpha$ be the coset $x+\langle p(x)\rangle$ in $E$. Show that for the evaluation homomorphism $\phi_{\alpha}: F[x] \rightarrow E$, we have $\phi_{\alpha}(f(x))=0$. That is, $\alpha$ is a zero of $f(x)$ in $E$.

An example of a field constructed according to this outline is given in Section 29. There, we give addition and multiplication tables for the field $\mathbb{Z}_{2}[x] /\left\langle x^{2}+x+1\right\rangle$. We show there that this field has just four elements, the cosets

$$
0+\left\langle x^{2}+x+1\right\rangle, \quad 1+\left\langle x^{2}+x+1\right\rangle, \quad x+\left\langle x^{2}+x+1\right\rangle,
$$

and

$$
(x+1)+\left\langle x^{2}+x+1\right\rangle .
$$

We rename these four cosets $0,1, \alpha$, and $\alpha+1$ respectively, and obtain Tables 29.20 and 29.21 for addition and multiplication in this 4 -element field. To see how these tables are constructed, remember that we are in a field of characteristic 2 , so that $\alpha+\alpha=$ $\alpha(1+1)=\alpha 0=0$. Remember also that $\alpha$ is a zero of $x^{2}+x+1$, so that $\alpha^{2}+\alpha+1=0$ and consequently $\alpha^{2}=-\alpha-1=\alpha+1$.

25. Corollary 27.18 tells us that every ring with unity contains a subring isomorphic to either $\mathbb{Z}$ or some $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$.

$$
N=\{r(x) f(x)+s(x) g(x) \mid r(x), s(x) \in F[x]\}
$$

is an ideal of $F[x]$. Show that if $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ have different degrees and $N \neq F[x]$, then $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ cannot both be irreducible over $F$.

33. Use Theorem 27.24 to prove the equivalence of these two theorems:

Fundamental Theorem of Algebra: Every nonconstant polynomial in $\mathbb{C}[x]$ has a zero in $\mathbb{C}$.

Nullstellensatz for $\mathbb{C}[x]$ : Let $f_{1}(x), \cdots, f_{r}(x) \in \mathbb{C}[x]$ and suppose that every $\alpha \in \mathbb{C}$ that is a zero of all $r$ of these polynomials is also a zero of a polynomial $g(x)$ in $\mathbb{C}[x]$. Then some power of $g(x)$ is in the smallest ideal of $\mathbb{C}[x]$ that contains the $r$ polynomials $f_{1}(x), \cdots, f_{r}(x)$.

There is a sort of arithmetic of ideals in a ring. The next three exercises define sum, product, and quotient of ideals.

A+B=\{a+b \mid a \in A, b \in B\} .
$$

b. Show that $A \subseteq A+B$ and $B \subseteq A+B$.

35. Let $A$ and $B$ be ideals of a ring $R$. The product $A B$ of $A$ and $B$ is defined by

$$
A B=\left\{\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i} \mid a_{i} \in A, b_{i} \in B, n \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}\right\}
$$

a. Show that $A B$ is an ideal in $R$.
b. Show that $A B \subseteq(A \cap B)$.

36. Let $A$ and $B$ be ideals of a commutative ring $R$. The quotient $A: B$ of $A$ by $B$ is defined by

$$
A: B=\{r \in R \mid r b \in A \text { for all } b \in B\} .
$$

Show that $A: B$ is an ideal of $R$.

37. Show that for a field $F$, the set $S$ of all matrices of the form

$$
\left(\begin{array}{ll}
a & b \\
0 & 0
\end{array}\right)
$$

for $a, b \in F$ is a right ideal but not a left ideal of $M_{2}(F)$. That is, show that $S$ is a subring closed under multiplication on the right by any element of $M_{2}(F)$, but is not closed under left multiplication.

38. Show that the matrix ring $M_{2}\left(\mathbb{Z}_{2}\right)$ is a simple ring; that is, $M_{2}\left(\mathbb{Z}_{2}\right)$ has no proper nontrivial ideals.

## SECTION 28 †GRÖBNER BASES FOR IDEALS

This section gives a brief introduction to algebraic geometry. In particular, we are concerned with the problem of finding as simple a description as we can of the set of common zeros of a finite number of polynomials. In order to accomplish our goal in a single section of this text, we will be stating a few theorems without proof. We recommend the book by Adams and Loustaunau [23] for the proofs and further study.[^16]

## Algebraic Varieties and Ideals

Let $F$ be a field. Recall that $F\left[x_{1}, x_{2}, \cdots, x_{n}\right]$ is the ring of polynomials in $n$ indeterminants $x_{1}, x_{2}, \cdots, x_{n}$ with coefficients in $F$. We let $F^{n}$ be the Cartesian product $F \times F \times \cdots \times F$ for $n$ factors. For ease in writing, we denote an element $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \cdots, a_{n}\right)$ of $F^{n}$ by a, in bold type. Using similar economy, we let $F[\mathbf{x}]=F\left[x_{1}, x_{2}, \cdots, x_{n}\right]$. For each $\mathbf{a} \in F^{n}$, we have an evaluation homomorphism $\phi_{\mathbf{a}}: F[\mathbf{x}] \rightarrow F$ just as in Theorem 22.4. That is, for $f(\mathbf{x})=f\left(x_{1}, x_{2}, \cdots, x_{n}\right) \in F[\mathbf{x}]$, we define $\phi_{\mathbf{a}}(f(\mathbf{x}))=f(\mathbf{a})=$ $f\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \cdots, a_{n}\right)$. The proof that $\phi_{\mathbf{a}}$ is indeed a homomorphism follows from the associative, commutative, and distributive properties of the operations in $F[\mathbf{x}]$ and $F$. Just as for the one-indeterminate case, an element $\mathbf{a}$ of $F^{n}$ is a zero of $f(\mathbf{x}) \in F[\mathbf{x}]$ if $f(\mathbf{a})=0$. In what follows, we further abbreviate a polynomial $f(\mathbf{x})$ by " $f$."

In this section we discuss the problem of finding common zeros in $F^{n}$ of a finite number of polynomials $f_{1}, f_{2}, \cdots, f_{r}$ in $F[\mathbf{x}]$. Finding and studying geometric properties of the set of all these common zeros is the subject of algebraic geometry.

28.1 Definition Let $S$ be a finite subset of $F[\mathbf{x}]$. The algebraic variety $V(S)$ in $F^{n}$ is the set of all common zeros in $F^{n}$ of the polynomials in $S$.

In our illustrative examples, which usually involve at most three indeterminates, we use $x, y, z$ in place of $x_{1}, x_{2}$, and $x_{3}$.

28.2 Example Let $S=\{2 x+y-2\} \subset \mathbb{R}[x, y]$. The algebraic variety $V(S)$ in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ is the line with $x$-intercept 1 and $y$-intercept 2.

We leave to Exercise 29 the straightforward proof that for $r$ elements $f_{1}, f_{2}, \cdots, f_{r}$ in a commutative ring $R$ with unity, the set

$$
I=\left\{c_{1} f_{1}+c_{2} f_{2}+\cdots+c_{r} f_{r} \mid c_{i} \in R \text { for } i=1, \cdots, r\right\}
$$

is an ideal of $R$. We denote this ideal by $\left\langle f_{1}, f_{2}, \cdots, f_{r}\right\rangle$. We are interested in the case $R=F[\mathbf{x}]$ where all the $c_{i}$ and all the $f_{i}$ are polynomials in $F[\mathbf{x}]$. We regard the $c_{i}$ as "coefficient polynomials." By its construction, this ideal $I$ is the smallest ideal containing the polynomials $f_{1}, f_{2}, \cdots, f_{r}$; it can also be described as the intersection of all ideals containing these $r$ polynomials.

28.3 Definition Let $I$ be an ideal in a commutative ring $R$ with unity. A subset $\left\{b_{1}, b_{2}, \cdots, b_{r}\right\}$ of $I$ is a basis for $I$ if $I=\left\langle b_{1}, b_{2}, \cdots, b_{r}\right\rangle$.

Unlike the situation in linear algebra, there is no requirement of independence for elements of a basis, or of unique representation of an ideal member in terms of a basis.

28.4 Theorem Let $f_{1}, f_{2}, \cdots, f_{r} \in F[\mathbf{x}]$. The set of common zeros in $F^{n}$ of the polynomials $f_{i}$ for $i=1,2, \cdots, r$ is the same as the set of common zeros in $F^{n}$ of all the polynomials in the entire ideal $I=\left\langle f_{1}, f_{2}, \cdots, f_{r}\right\rangle$.

Proof Let

$$
f=c_{1} f_{1}+c_{2} f_{2}+\cdots+c_{r} f_{r}
$$

## Part V Ideals and Factor Rings

be any element of $I$, and let $\mathbf{a} \in F^{n}$ be a common zero of $f_{1}, f_{2}, \cdots$, and $f_{r}$. Applying the evaluation homomorphism $\phi_{\mathrm{a}}$ to Eq. (1), we obtain

$$
\begin{aligned}
f(\mathbf{a}) & =c_{1}(\mathbf{a}) f_{1}(\mathbf{a})+c_{2}(\mathbf{a}) f_{2}(\mathbf{a})+\cdots+c_{r}(\mathbf{a}) f_{r}(\mathbf{a}) \\
& =c_{1}(\mathbf{a}) 0+c_{2}(\mathbf{a}) 0+\cdots+c_{r}(\mathbf{a}) 0=0,
\end{aligned}
$$

showing that a is also a zero of every polynomial $f$ in $I$. Of course, a zero of every polynomial in $I$ will be a zero of each $f_{i}$ because each $f_{i} \in I$.

For an ideal $I$ in $F[\mathbf{x}]$, we let $V(I)$ be the set of all common zeros of all elements of $I$. We can summarize Theorem 28.4 as

$$
V\left(\left\{f_{1}, f_{2}, \cdots, f_{r}\right\}\right)=V\left(\left\langle f_{1}, f_{2}, \cdots, f_{r}\right\rangle\right)
$$

We state without proof the Hilbert Basis Theorem. (See Adams and Loustaunau [23].)

28.5 Theorem (Hilbert Basis Theorem) Every ideal in $F\left[x_{1}, x_{2}, \cdots, x_{n}\right]$ has a finite basis.

Our objective: Given a basis for an ideal $I$ in $F[\mathbf{x}]$, modify it if possible to become a basis that better exhibits the structure of $I$ and the geometry of the associated algebraic variety $V(I)$.

The theorem that follows provides a tool for this task. You should notice that the theorem gives information about the division algorithm that we did not mention in Theorem 23.1. We use the same notation here as in Theorem 23.1, but with $\mathbf{x}$ rather than $x$. If $f(\mathbf{x})=g(\mathbf{x}) h(\mathbf{x})$ in $F(\mathbf{x})$, then $g(\mathbf{x})$ and $h[\mathbf{x}]$ are called "divisors" or "factors" of $f(\mathbf{x})$.

28.6 Theorem (Property of the Division Algorithm) Let $f(\mathbf{x}), g(\mathbf{x}), q(\mathbf{x})$ and $r(\mathbf{x})$ be polynomials in $F[\mathbf{x}]$ such that $f(\mathbf{x})=g(\mathbf{x}) q(\mathbf{x})+r(\mathbf{x})$. The common zeros in $F^{n}$ of $f(\mathbf{x})$ and $g(\mathbf{x})$ are the same as the common zeros of $g(\mathbf{x})$ and $r(\mathbf{x})$. Also the common divisors in $F[\mathbf{x}]$ of $f(\mathbf{x})$ and $g(\mathbf{x})$ are the same as the common divisors of $g(\mathbf{x})$ and $r(\mathbf{x})$.

If $f(\mathbf{x})$ and $g(\mathbf{x})$ are two members of a basis for an ideal $I$ of $F[\mathbf{x}]$, then replacement of $f(\mathbf{x})$ by $r(\mathbf{x})$ in the basis still yields a basis for $I$.

Proof If $\mathbf{a} \in F^{n}$ is a common zero of $g(\mathbf{x})$ and $r(\mathbf{x})$, then applying $\phi_{\mathbf{a}}$ to both sides of the equation $f(\mathbf{x})=g(\mathbf{x}) q(\mathbf{x})+r(\mathbf{x})$, we obtain $f(\mathbf{a})=g(\mathbf{a}) q(\mathbf{a})+r(\mathbf{a})=0 q(\mathbf{a})+0=0$, so $\mathbf{a}$ is a zero of both $f(\mathbf{x})$ and $g(\mathbf{x})$. If $\mathbf{b} \in F[\mathbf{x}]$ is a common zero of $f(\mathbf{x})$ and $g(\mathbf{x})$, then applying $\phi_{\mathbf{b}}$ yields $f(\mathbf{b})=g(\mathbf{b}) q(\mathbf{b})+r(\mathbf{b})$ so $0=0 q(\mathbf{b})+r(\mathbf{b})$ and we see that $r(\mathbf{b})=0$ as well as $g(\mathbf{b})$.

The proof concerning common divisors is essentially the same, and is left as Exercise 30.

Finally, let $B$ be a basis for an ideal $I$, let $f(\mathbf{x}), g(\mathbf{x}), \in B$ and let $f(\mathbf{x})=g(\mathbf{x}) q(\mathbf{x})+$ $r(\mathbf{x})$. Let $B^{\prime}$ be the set obtained by replacing $f(\mathbf{x})$ by $r(\mathbf{x})$ in $B$, and let $I^{\prime}$ be the ideal having $B^{\prime}$ as a basis. Let $S$ be the set obtained from $B$ by adjoining $r(\mathbf{x})$ to $B$. Note that $S$ can also be obtained by adjoining $f(\mathbf{x})$ to $B^{\prime}$. The equation $f(\mathbf{x})=g(\mathbf{x}) q(\mathbf{x})+r(\mathbf{x})$
shows that $f(\mathbf{x}) \in I^{\prime}$, so we have $B^{\prime} \subseteq S \subseteq I^{\prime}$. Thus $S$ is a basis for $I^{\prime}$. The equation $r(\mathbf{x})=f(\mathbf{x})-q(\mathbf{x}) g(\mathbf{x})$ shows that $r(\mathbf{x}) \in I$, so we have $B \subseteq S \subseteq I$. Thus $S$ is basis for $I$. Therefore $I=I^{\prime}$ and $B^{\prime}$ is a basis for $I$.

## A Familiar Linear Illustration

A basic technique for problem solving in linear algebra is finding all common solutions of a finite number of linear equations. For the moment we abandon our practice of never writing " $f(\mathbf{x})=0$ " for a nonzero polynomial, and work a typical problem as we do in a linear algebra course.

(Solution as in a Linear Algebra Course) Find all solutions in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ of the linear system

$$
\begin{aligned}
x+y-3 z & =8 \\
2 x+y+z & =-5 .
\end{aligned}
$$

Solution We multiply the first equation by -2 and add it to the second, obtaining the new system

$$
\begin{aligned}
x+y-3 z & =8 \\
-y+7 z & =-21
\end{aligned}
$$

which has the same solution set in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ as the preceding one. For any value $z$, we can find the corresponding $y$-value from the second equation and then determine $x$ from the first equation. Keeping $z$ as parameter, we obtain $\{(-4 z-13,7 z+21, z) \mid z \in \mathbb{R}\}$ as solution set, which is a line in Euclidean 3-space through the point $(-13,21,0)$.

In the notation of this section, the problem in the preceding example can be phrased as follows:

$$
\text { Describe } V(\langle x+y-3 z-8,2 x+y+z+5\rangle) \text { in } \mathbb{R}^{3} \text {. }
$$

We solved it by finding a more useful basis, namely

$$
\{x+y-3 z-8,-y+7 z+21\} .
$$

Notice that the second member, $-y+7 z+21$, of this new basis can be obtained from the original two basis polynomials as a remainder $r(x, y, z)$ in a division process, namely

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_01_27_9289ad7bed1dd2e5e553g-262.jpg?height=211&width=552&top_left_y=1854&top_left_x=987)

Thus $2 x+y+z+5=(x+y-3 z-8)(2)+(-y+7 z+21)$, an expression of the form $f(x, y, z)=g(x, y, z) q(x, y, z)+r(x, y, z)$. We replaced the polynomial $f$ by the polynomial $r$, as in Theorem 28.6, which assures us that $V(\langle f, g\rangle)=V(\langle g, r\rangle)$ and that $\langle f, g\rangle=\langle g, r\rangle$. We chose a very simple, 1-step problem in Example 28.7. However, it is clear that the method introduced in a linear algebra course for solving a linear system can be phrased in terms of applying a division algorithm process repeatedly to change a given ideal basis into one that better illuminates the geometry of the associated algebraic variety.

## A Single Indeterminate Illustration

Suppose now that we want to find the variety $V(I)$ in $\mathbb{R}$ associated with an ideal $I$ in $F[x]$, the ring of polynomials in the single indeterminate $x$. By Theorem 27.24, every ideal in $F[x]$ is principal, so there exists $f(x) \in F[x]$ such that $I=\langle f(x)\rangle$. Thus $V(I)$ consists of the zeros of a single polynomial, and $\{f(x)\}$ is probably as simple a basis for $I$ as we could desire. We give an example illustrating computation of such a single generator $f(x)$ for $I$ in a case where the given basis for $I$ contains more than one polynomial. Because a polynomial in $\mathbb{R}[x]$ has only a finite number of zeros in $\mathbb{R}$, we expect two or more randomly selected polynomials in $\mathbb{R}[x]$ to have no common zeros, but we constructed the basis in our example carefully!

28.8 Example

Let us describe the algebraic variety $V$ in $\mathbb{R}$ consisting of common zeros of

$$
f(x)=x^{4}+x^{3}-3 x^{2}-5 x-2 \quad \text { and } \quad g(x)=x^{3}+3 x^{2}-6 x-8
$$

We want to find a new basis for $\langle f, g\rangle$ having polynomials of as small degree as possible, so we use the division algorithm $f(x)=g(x) q(x)+r(x)$ in Theorem 23.1, where $r(x)$ will have degree at most 2 . We then replace the basis $\{f, g\}$ by the basis $\{g, r\}$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& x-2 \\
& \hline x^{3}+3 x^{2}-6 x-8 \sqrt{x^{4}+x^{3}-3 x^{2}-5 x-2} \\
& \frac{x^{4}+3 x^{3}-6 x^{2}-8 x}{-2 x^{3}+3 x^{2}+3 x-2} \\
& \frac{-2 x^{3}-6 x^{2}+12 x+16}{9 x^{2}-9 x-18}
\end{aligned}
$$

Because zeros of $9 x^{2}-9 x-18$ are the same as zeros of $x^{2}-x-2$, we let $r(x)=$ $x^{2}-x-2$, and take as new basis

$$
\{g, r\}=\left(x^{3}+3 x^{2}-6 x-8, x^{2}-x-2\right) .
$$

By dividing $g(x)$ by $r(x)$ to obtain a remainder $r_{1}(x)$, we will now be able to find a basis $\left\{r(x), r_{1}(x)\right\}$ consisting of polynomials of degree at most 2 .

$$
\begin{array}{r}
\frac{x+4}{x^{2}-x-2 \sqrt{x^{3}+3 x^{2}-6 x-8}} \\
\hline \frac{x^{3}-x^{2}-2 x}{4 x^{2}-4 x-8} \\
\frac{4 x^{2}-4 x-8}{0}
\end{array}
$$

Our new basis $\left\{r(x), r_{1}(x)\right\}$ now becomes $\left\{x^{2}-x-2\right\}$. Thus $I=\langle f(x), g(x)\rangle=$ $\left\langle x^{2}-x-2\right\rangle=\langle(x-2)(x+1)\rangle$, and we see that $V=\{-1,2\}$.

Theorem 28.6 tells us that the common divisors of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ in the preceding example are the same as the common divisors of $r(x)$ and $r_{1}(x)$. Because $0=(0) r(x)$, we see that $r(x)$ itself divides 0 , so the common divisors of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are just those of $r(x)$, which, of course, include $r(x)$ itself. Thus $r(x)$ is called a "greatest common divisor" (abbreviated gcd) of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$.

## Gröbner Bases

We tackle the problem of finding a nice basis for an ideal $I$ in $F[\mathbf{x}]=F\left[x_{1}, x_{2}, \cdots, x_{n}\right]$. In view of our illustrations for the linear and single indeterminant cases, it seems reasonable to try to replace polynomials in a basis by polynomials of lower degree, or containing fewer indeterminates. It is crucial to have a systematic way to accomplish this. Every instructor in linear algebra has had an occasional student who refuses to master matrix reduction and creates zero entries in columns of a matrix in an almost random fashion, rather than finishing the first column and then proceeding to the second, etc. As a first step in our goal, we tackle this problem of specifying an order for polynomials in a basis.

Our polynomials in $F[\mathbf{x}]$ have terms of the form $a x_{1}^{m_{1}} x_{2}^{m_{2}} \cdots x_{n}{ }^{m_{n}}$ where $a \in F$.

## Properties for an Ordering of Power Products

1. $1<P$ for all power products $P \neq 1$.
2. For any two power products $P_{i}$ and $P_{j}$, exactly one of $P_{i}<P_{j}, P_{i}=P_{j}, P_{j}<P_{i}$ holds.
3. If $P_{i}<P_{j}$ and $P_{j}<P_{k}$, then $P_{i}<P_{k}$.
4. If $P_{i}<P_{j}$, then $P P_{i}<P P_{j}$ for any power product $P$.

Let us consider a power product in $F[\mathbf{x}]$ to be an expression

$$
P=x_{1}^{m_{1}} x_{2}^{m_{2}} \cdots x_{n}^{m_{n}} \text { where all the } m_{i} \geq 0 \text { in } \mathbb{Z} \text {. }
$$

Notice that all $x_{i}$ are present, perhaps some with exponent 0 . Thus in $F[x, y, z\}$, we must write $x z^{2}$ as $x y^{0} z^{2}$ to be a power product. We want to describe a total ordering $<$ on the set of all power products so that we know just what it means to say that $P_{i}<P_{j}$ for two power products, providing us with a notion of relative size for power products. We can then try to change an ideal basis in a systematic way to create one with polynomials having terms $a_{i} P_{i}$ with as "small" power products $P_{i}$ as possible. We denote by 1 the power product with all exponents 0 , and require that an ordering of the power products has the properties shown in the box. Suppose that such an ordering has been described and that $P_{i} \neq P_{j}$ and $P_{i}$ divides $P_{j}$ so that $P_{j}=P P_{i}$ where $1<P$. From Property 4 in the box, we then have $1 P_{i}<P P_{i}=P_{j}$, so $P_{i}<P_{j}$. Thus $P_{i}$ divides $P_{j}$ implies that $P_{i}<P_{j}$. In Exercise 28, we ask you to show by a counterexample that $P_{i}<P_{j}$ does not imply that $P_{i}$ divides $P_{j}$.

It can also be shown that these properties guarantee that any step-by-step process for modifying a finite ideal basis that does not increase the size of any maximal power product in a basis element and replaces at least one by something smaller at each step will terminate in a finite number of steps.

In $F[x]$ with $x$ the only indeterminate, there is only one power product ordering, for by Property 1 , we must have $1<x$. Multiplying repeatedly by $x$ and using Property 4 , we have $x<x^{2}, x^{2}<x^{3}$, etc. Property 3 then shows that $1<x<x^{2}<x^{3}<\cdots$ is the only possible order. Notice that in Example 28.8, we modified a basis by replacing basis polynomials by polynomials containing smaller power products.

There are a number of possible orderings for power products in $F[\mathbf{x}]$ with $n$ indeterminates. We present just one, the lexicographical order (denoted by "lex"). In lex, we define

$$
x_{1}^{s_{1}} x_{2}^{s_{2}} \cdots x_{n}^{s_{n}}<x_{1}^{t_{1}} x_{2}^{t_{2}} \cdots x_{n}^{t_{n}}
$$

if and only if $s_{i}<t_{i}$ for the first subscript $i$, reading from left to right, such that $s_{i} \neq t_{i}$. Thus in $F[x, y]$, if we write power products in the order $x^{n} y^{m}$, we have $y=x^{0} y^{1}<$ $x^{1} y^{0}=x$ and $x y<x y^{2}$. Using lex, the order of $n$ indeterminates is given by $1<x_{n}<$ $x_{n-1}<\cdots<x_{2}<x_{1}$. Our reduction in Example 28.7, where we first got rid of all "big" $x$ 's that we could and then the "smaller" $y$ 's, corresponded to the lex order $z<y<x$, that is, to writing all power products in the $x^{m} y^{n} z^{s}$ order. For the two-indeterminate case with $y<x$, the total lex term order schematically is

$$
1<y<y^{2}<y^{3} \cdots<x<x y<x y^{2}<x y^{3}<\cdots<x^{2}<x^{2} y<x^{2} y^{2}<\cdots \text {. }
$$

An ordering of power products $P$ induces an obvious ordering of terms $a P$ of a polynomial in $F[\mathbf{x}]$, which we will refer to as a term order. From now on, given an ordering of power products, we consider every polynomial $f$ in $F[\mathbf{x}]$ to be written in decreasing order of terms, so that the leading (first) term has the highest order. We denote by $1 \mathrm{t}(f)$ the leading term of $f$ and by $1 \mathrm{p}(f)$ the power product of the leading term. If $f$ and $g$ are polynomials in $F[\mathbf{x}]$ such that $1 \mathrm{p}(g)$ divides $1 \mathrm{p}(f)$, then we can execute a division of $f$ by $g$, as illustrated in the linear and one-indeterminate cases, to obtain $f(\mathbf{x})=g(\mathbf{x}) q(\mathbf{x})+r(\mathbf{x})$ where $1 \mathrm{p}(r)<1 \mathrm{p}(f)$. Note that we did not say that $1 \mathrm{p}(r)<1 \mathrm{p}(g)$. We illustrate with an example.

28.9 Example By division, reduce the basis $\left\{x y^{2}, y^{2}-y\right\}$ for the ideal $I=\left\langle x y^{2}, y^{2}-y\right\rangle$ in $\mathbb{R}[x, y]$ to one with smaller maximum term size, assuming the order lex with $y<x$.

Solution We see that $y^{2}$ divides $x y^{2}$ and compute

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_01_27_9289ad7bed1dd2e5e553g-265.jpg?height=211&width=276&top_left_y=1621&top_left_x=1049)

Because $y^{2}$ does not divide $x y$, we cannot continue the division. Note that $1 \mathrm{p}(x y)=x y$ is not less than $1 \mathrm{p}\left(y^{2}-y\right)=y^{2}$. However, we do have $1 \mathrm{p}(x y)<1 \mathrm{p}\left(x y^{2}\right)$. Our new basis for $I$ is $\left\{x y, y^{2}-y\right\}$.

When dealing with more than one indeterminate, it is often easier to perform basis reduction by multiplying a basis polynomial $g(\mathbf{x})$ by a polynomial $-q(\mathbf{x})$ and adding it to a polynomial $f(\mathbf{x})$ to obtain $r(\mathbf{x})$, as we perform matrix reduction in linear algebra, rather than writing out the division display as we did in the preceding example. Starting with basis polynomials $x y^{2}$ and $y^{2}-y$, we can reduce the $x y^{2}$ by multiplying $y^{2}-y$ by $-x$ and adding the resulting $-x y^{2}+x y$ to $x y^{2}$, obtaining the replacement $x y$ for $x y^{2}$. We can do that in our head, and write down the result directly.

Referring again to Example 28.9, it will follow from what we state later that given any polynomial $f(x, y)=c_{1}(x, y)(x y)+c_{2}(x, y)\left(y^{2}-y\right)$ in $\left\langle x y, y^{2}-y\right\rangle$, either $x y$ or
$y^{2}$ will divide $1 \mathrm{p}(f)$. (See Exercises 31.) This illustrates the defining property of a Gröbner basis.

28.10 Definition A set $\left\{g_{1}, g_{2}, \cdots, g_{r}\right\}$ of nonzero polynomials in $F\left[x_{1}, x_{2}, \cdots, x_{n}\right]$, with term ordering $<$, is a Gröbner basis for the ideal $I=\left\langle g_{1}, g_{2}, \cdots, g_{r}\right\rangle$ if and only if, for each nonzero $f \in I$, there exists some $i$ where $1 \leq i \leq r$ such that $1 \mathrm{p}\left(g_{i}\right)$ divides $1 \mathrm{p}(f)$.

While we have illustrated the computation of a Gröbner basis from a given basis for an ideal in Examples 28.7, 28.8, and 28.9, we have not given a specific algorithm. We refer the reader to Adams and Loustaunau [23]. The method consists of multiplying some polynomial in the basis by any polynomial in $F[\mathbf{x}]$ and adding the result to another polynomial in the basis in a manner that reduces the size of power products. In our illustrations, we have treated the case involving division of $f(\mathbf{x})$ by $g(\mathbf{x})$ where $1 \mathrm{p}(g)$ divides $1 \mathrm{p}(f)$, but we can also use the process if $1 \mathrm{p}(g)$ only divides some other power product in $f$. For example, if two elements in a basis are $x y-y^{3}$ and $y^{2}-1$, we can multiply $y^{2}-1$ by $y$ and add it to $x y-y^{3}$, reducing $x y-y^{3}$ to $x y-y$. Theorem 28.6 shows that this is a valid computation.

You may wonder how any basis $\left\{g_{1}, g_{2}, \cdots, g_{r}\right\}$ can fail to be a Gröbner basis for $I=\left\langle g_{1}, g_{2}, \cdots, g_{r}\right\rangle$ because, when we form an element $c_{1} g_{1}+c_{2} g_{2}+\cdots+c_{r} g_{r}$ in $I$, we see that $1 \mathrm{p}\left(g_{i}\right)$ is a divisor of $1 \mathrm{p}\left(c_{i} g_{i}\right)$ for $i=1,2, \cdots, r$. However, cancellation of power products can occur in the addition. We illustrate with an example.

28.11 Example Consider the ideal $I=\left\langle x^{2} y-2, x y^{2}-y\right\rangle$ in $\mathbb{R}[x, y\}$. The polynomials in the basis shown cannot be reduced further. However, the ideal $I$ contains $y\left(x^{2} y-2\right)-x\left(x y^{2}-\right.$ $y)=x y-2 y$, whose leading power product $x y$ is not divisible by either of the leading power products $x^{2} y$ or $x y^{2}$ of the given basis. Thus $\left\{x^{2} y-2, x y^{2}-y\right\}$ is not a Gröbner basis for $I$, according to Definition 28.10.

When we run into a situation like that in Example 28.11, we realize that a Gröbner basis must contain some polynomial with a smaller leading power product than those in the given basis. Let $f$ and $g$ be polynomials in the given basis. Just as we did in Example 28.11, we can multiply $f$ and $g$ by as small power products as possible so that the resulting two leading power products will be the same, the least common multiple $(\mathrm{lcm})$ of $1 \mathrm{p}(f)$ and $1 \mathrm{p}(g)$, and then subtract or add with suitable coefficients from $F$ so cancellation results. We denote a polynomial formed in this fashion by $S(f, g)$. We state without proof a theorem that can be used to test whether a basis is a Gröbner basis.

A basis $G=\left\{g_{1}, g_{2}, \cdots, g_{r}\right\}$ is a Gröbner basis for the ideal $\left\langle g_{1}, g_{2}, \cdots, g_{r}\right\rangle$ if and only if, for all $i \neq j$, the polynomial $S\left(g_{i}, g_{j}\right)$ can be reduced to zero by repeatedly dividing remainders by elements of $G$, as in the division algorithm.

As we mentioned before, we may prefer to think of reducing $S\left(g_{i}, g_{j}\right)$ by a sequence of operations consisting of adding (or subtracting) multiples of polynomials in $G$, rather than writing out division.

We can now indicate how we can obtain a Gröbner basis from a given basis. First, reduce the polynomials in the basis as far as possible among themselves. Then choose
polynomials $g_{i}$ and $g_{j}$ in the basis, and form the polynomial $S\left(g_{i}, g_{j}\right)$. See if $S\left(g_{i}, g_{j}\right)$ can be reduced to zero as just described. If so, choose a different pair of polynomials, and repeat the procedure with them. If $S\left(g_{i}, g_{j}\right)$ cannot be reduced to zero as described above, augment the given basis with this $S\left(g_{i}, g_{j}\right)$, and start all over, reducing this basis as much as possible. By Theorem 28.12, when every polynomial $S\left(g_{i}, g_{j}\right)$ for all $i \neq j$ can be reduced to zero using polynomials from the latest basis, we have arrived at a Gröbner basis. We conclude with a continuation of Example 28.11.

28.13 Example Continuing Example 2.8.11, let $g_{1}=x^{2} y-2, g_{2}=x y^{2}-y$, and $I=\left\langle g_{1}, g_{2}\right\rangle$ in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$. In Example 28.11, we obtained the polynomial $S\left(g_{1}, g_{2}\right)=x y-2 y$, which cannot be reduced to zero using $g_{1}$ and $g_{2}$. We now reduce the basis $\left\{x^{2} y-2, x y^{2}-y, x y-2 y\right\}$, indicating each step.

$$
\begin{array}{cl}
\left\{x^{2} y-2, x y^{2}-y, x y-2 y\right\} & \text { augmented basis } \\
\left\{2 x y-2, x y^{2}-y, x y-2 y\right\} & \text { by adding }(-x) \text { (third) to first } \\
\left\{2 x y-2,2 y^{2}-y, x y-2 y\right\} & \text { by adding }(-y) \text { (third) to second } \\
\left\{4 y-2,2 y^{2}-y, x y-2 y\right\} & \text { by adding }(-2) \text { (third) to first } \\
\{4 y-2,0, x y-2 y\} & \text { by adding }\left(-\frac{y}{2}\right) \text { (first) to second } \\
\left\{4 y-2,0, \frac{1}{2} x-2 y\right\} & \text { by adding }\left(-\frac{x}{4}\right) \text { (first) to third } \\
\left\{4 y-2,0, \frac{1}{2} x-1\right\} & \text { by adding }\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)(\text { first }) \text { to third }
\end{array}
$$

Clearly, $\left\{y-\frac{1}{2}, x-2\right\}$ is a Gröbner basis. Note that if $f=y-\frac{1}{2}$ and $g=x-2$, then $S(f, g)=x f-y g=\left(x y-\frac{x}{2}\right)-(x y-2 y)=-\frac{x}{2}+2 y$, which can readily be reduced to zero by adding $\frac{1}{2}(x-2)$ and $-2\left(y-\frac{1}{2}\right)$.

From the Gröbner basis, we see that the algebraic variety $V(I)$ contains only one point, $\left(2, \frac{1}{2}\right)$, in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$.

The importance of Gröbner bases in applications is due to the fact that they are machine computable. They have applications to engineering and computer science as well as to mathematics.

## SECTION 29 Introduction to Extension Fields

## Our Basic Goal Achieved

We are now in a position to achieve our basic goal, which, loosely stated, is to show that every nonconstant polynomial has a zero. This will be stated more precisely and proved in Theorem 29.3. We first introduce some new terminology for some old ideas.

29.1 Definition

A field $E$ is an extension field of a field $F$ if $F \leq E$.

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_01_27_9289ad7bed1dd2e5e553g-270.jpg?height=312&width=417&top_left_y=1687&top_left_x=1041)

29.2 Figure

Thus $\mathbb{R}$ is an extension field of $\mathbb{Q}$, and $\mathbb{C}$ is an extension field of both $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{Q}$. As in the study of groups, it will often be convenient to use subfield diagrams to picture extension fields, the larger field being on top. We illustrate this in Fig. 29.2. A configuration where there is just one single column of fields, as at the left-hand side of Fig. 29.2, is often referred to, without any precise definition, as a tower of fields.[^17]

Now for our basic goal! This great and important result follows quickly and elegantly from the techniques we now have at our disposal.

29.3 Theorem (Kronecker's Theorem) (Basic Goal) Let $F$ be a field and let $f(x)$ be a nonconstant polynomial in $F[x]$. Then there exists an extension field $E$ of $F$ and an $\alpha \in E$ such that $f(\alpha)=0$.

Proof By Theorem 23.20, $f(x)$ has a factorization in $F[x]$ into polynomials that are irreducible over $F$. Let $p(x)$ be an irreducible polynomial in such a factorization. It is clearly sufficient to find an extension field $E$ of $F$ containing an element $\alpha$ such that $p(\alpha)=0$.

By Theorem 27.25, $\langle p(x)\rangle$ is a maximal ideal in $F[x]$, so $F[x] /\langle p(x)\rangle$ is a field. We claim that $F$ can be identified with a subfield of $F[x] /\langle p(x)\rangle$ in a natural way by use of the map $\psi: F \rightarrow F[x] /\langle p(x)\rangle$ given by

$$
\psi(a)=a+\langle p(x)\rangle
$$

for $a \in F$. This map is one to one, for if $\psi(a)=\psi(b)$, that is, if $a+\langle p(x)\rangle=b+\langle p(x)\rangle$ for some $a, b \in F$, then $(a-b) \in\langle p(x)\rangle$, so $a-b$ must be a multiple of the polynomial $p(x)$, which is of degree $\geq 1$. Now $a, b \in F$ implies that $a-b$ is in $F$. Thus we must have $a-b=0$, so $a=b$. We defined addition and multiplication in $F[x] /\langle p(x)\rangle$ by choosing any representatives, so we may choose $a \in(a+\langle p(x)\rangle)$. Thus $\psi$ is a homomorphism that maps $F$ one-to-one onto a subfield of $F[x] /\langle p(x)\rangle$. We identify $F$ with $\{a+\langle p(x)\rangle \mid a \in F\}$ by means of this map $\psi$. Thus we shall view $E=F[x] /\langle p(x)\rangle$ as an extension field of $F$. We have now manufactured our desired extension field $E$ of $F$. It remains for us to show that $E$ contains a zero of $p(x)$.

Let us set

$$
\alpha=x+\langle p(x)\rangle
$$

so $\alpha \in E$. Consider the evaluation homomorphism $\phi_{\alpha}: F[x] \rightarrow E$, given by Theorem 22.4. If $p(x)=a_{0}+a_{1} x+\cdots+a_{n} x^{n}$, where $a_{i} \in F$, then we have

$$
\phi_{\alpha}(p(x))=a_{0}+a_{1}(x+\langle p(x)\rangle)+\cdots+a_{n}(x+\langle p(x)\rangle)^{n}
$$

## Historical Note

T eopold Kronecker is known for his insistence Lon constructibility of mathematical objects. As he noted, "God made the integers; all else is the work of man." Thus, he wanted to be able to construct new "domains of rationality" (fields) by using only the existence of integers and indeterminates. He did not believe in starting with the real or complex numbers, because as far as he was concerned, those fields could not be determined in a constructive way. Hence in an 1881 paper, Kronecker created an extension field by simply adjoining to a given field a root $\alpha$ of an irreducible $n$th degree polynomial $p(x)$; that is, his new field consisted of expressions rational in the original field elements and his new root $\alpha$ with the condition that $p(\alpha)=0$. The proof of the theorem presented in the text (Theorem 29.3) dates from the twentieth century.

Kronecker completed his dissertation in 1845 at the University of Berlin. For many years thereafter, he managed the family business, ultimately becoming financially independent. He then returned to Berlin, where he was elected to the Academy of Sciences and thus permitted to lecture at the university. On the retirement of Kummer, he became a professor at Berlin, and with Karl Weierstrass (18151897) directed the influential mathematics seminar.
in $E=F[x] /\langle p(x)\rangle$. But we can compute in $F[x] /\langle p(x)\rangle$ by choosing representatives, and $x$ is a representative of the coset $\alpha=x+\langle p(x)\rangle$. Therefore,

$$
\begin{aligned}
p(\alpha) & =\left(a_{0}+a_{1} x+\cdots+a_{n} x^{n}\right)+\langle p(x)\rangle \\
& =p(x)+\langle p(x)\rangle=\langle p(x)\rangle=0
\end{aligned}
$$

in $F[x] /\langle p(x)\rangle$. We have found an element $\alpha$ in $E=F[x] /\langle p(x)\rangle$ such that $p(\alpha)=0$, and therefore $f(\alpha)=0$.

We illustrate the construction involved in the proof of Theorem 29.3 by two examples.

29.4 Example Let $F=\mathbb{R}$, and let $f(x)=x^{2}+1$, which is well known to have no zeros in $\mathbb{R}$ and thus is irreducible over $\mathbb{R}$ by Theorem 23.10 . Then $\left\langle x^{2}+1\right\rangle$ is a maximal ideal in $\mathbb{R}[x]$, so $\mathbb{R}[x] /\left\langle x^{2}+1\right\rangle$ is a field. Identifying $r \in \mathbb{R}$ with $r+\left\langle x^{2}+1\right\rangle$ in $\mathbb{R}[x] /\left\langle x^{2}+1\right\rangle$, we can view $\mathbb{R}$ as a subfield of $E=\mathbb{R}[x] /\left\langle x^{2}+1\right\rangle$. Let

$$
\alpha=x+\left\langle x^{2}+1\right\rangle .
$$

Computing in $\mathbb{R}[x] /\left\langle x^{2}+1\right\rangle$, we find

$$
\begin{aligned}
\alpha^{2}+1 & =\left(x+\left\langle x^{2}+1\right\rangle\right)^{2}+\left(1+\left\langle x^{2}+1\right\rangle\right) \\
& =\left(x^{2}+1\right)+\left\langle x^{2}+1\right\rangle=0 .
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus $\alpha$ is a zero of $x^{2}+1$. We shall identify $\mathbb{R}[x] /\left\langle x^{2}+1\right\rangle$ with $\mathbb{C}$ at the close of this section.

29.5 Example Let $F=\mathbb{Q}$, and consider $f(x)=x^{4}-5 x^{2}+6$. This time $f(x)$ factors in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$ into $\left(x^{2}-2\right)\left(x^{2}-3\right)$, both factors being irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$, as we have seen. We can start with $x^{2}-2$ and construct an extension field $E$ of $\mathbb{Q}$ containing $\alpha$ such that $\alpha^{2}-2=0$, or we can construct an extension field $K$ of $\mathbb{Q}$ containing an element $\beta$ such that $\beta^{2}-3=0$. The construction in either case is just as in Example 29.4.

## Algebraic and Transcendental Elements

As we said before, most of the rest of this text is devoted to the study of zeros of polynomials. We commence this study by putting an element of an extension field $E$ of a field $F$ into one of two categories.

29.6 Definition An element $\alpha$ of an extension field $E$ of a field $F$ is algebraic over $F$ if $f(\alpha)=0$ for some nonzero $f(x) \in F[x]$. If $\alpha$ is not algebraic over $F$, then $\alpha$ is transcendental over $F$.

29.7 Example $\mathbb{C}$ is an extension field of $\mathbb{Q}$. Since $\sqrt{2}$ is a zero of $x^{2}-2$, we see that $\sqrt{2}$ is an algebraic element over $\mathbb{Q}$. Also, $i$ is an algebraic element over $\mathbb{Q}$, being a zero of $x^{2}+1$.

29.8 Example It is well known (but not easy to prove) that the real numbers $\pi$ and $e$ are transcendental over $\mathbb{Q}$. Here $e$ is the base for the natural logarithms.

Just as we do not speak simply of an irreducible polynomial, but rather of an irreducible polynomial over $F$, similarly we don't speak simply of an algebraic element, but rather of an element algebraic over $F$. The following illustration shows the reason for this.

29.9 Example The real number $\pi$ is transcendental over $\mathbb{Q}$, as we stated in Example 29.8. However, $\pi$ is algebraic over $\mathbb{R}$, for it is a zero of $(x-\pi) \in \mathbb{R}[x]$.

29.10 Example It is easy to see that the real number $\sqrt{1+\sqrt{3}}$ is algebraic over $\mathbb{Q}$. For if $\alpha=\sqrt{1+\sqrt{3}}$, then $\alpha^{2}=1+\sqrt{3}$, so $\alpha^{2}-1=\sqrt{3}$ and $\left(\alpha^{2}-1\right)^{2}=3$. Therefore $\alpha^{4}-2 \alpha^{2}-2=0$, so $\alpha$ is a zero of $x^{4}-2 x^{2}-2$, which is in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$.

To connect these ideas with those of number theory, we give the following definition.

29.11 Definition An element of $\mathbb{C}$ that is algebraic over $\mathbb{Q}$ is an algebraic number. A transcendental number is an element of $\mathbb{C}$ that is transcendental over $\mathbb{Q}$.

There is an extensive and elegant theory of algebraic numbers. (See the Bibliography.)

The next theorem gives a useful characterization of algebraic and transcendental elements over $F$ in an extension field $E$ of $F$. It also illustrates the importance of our evaluation homomorphisms $\phi_{\alpha}$. Note that once more we are describing our concepts in terms of mappings.

29.12 Theorem Let $E$ be an extension field of a field $F$ and let $\alpha \in E$. Let $\phi_{\alpha}: F[x] \rightarrow E$ be the evaluation homomorphism of $F[x]$ into $E$ such that $\phi_{\alpha}(a)=a$ for $a \in F$ and $\phi_{\alpha}(x)=\alpha$. Then $\alpha$ is transcendental over $F$ if and only if $\phi_{\alpha}$ gives an isomorphism of $F[x]$ with a subdomain of $E$, that is, if and only if $\phi_{\alpha}$ is a one-to-one map.

Proof The element $\alpha$ is transcendental over $F$ if and only if $f(\alpha) \neq 0$ for all nonzero $f(x) \in$ $F[x]$, which is true (by definition) if and only if $\phi_{\alpha}(f(x)) \neq 0$ for all nonzero $f(x) \in$ $F[x]$, which is true if and only if the kernel of $\phi_{\alpha}$ is $\{0\}$, that is, if and only if $\phi_{\alpha}$ is a one-to-one map.

## The Irreducible Polynomial for $\alpha$ over $\boldsymbol{F}$

Consider the extension field $\mathbb{R}$ of $\mathbb{Q}$. We know that $\sqrt{2}$ is algebraic over $\mathbb{Q}$, being a zero of $x^{2}-2$. Of course, $\sqrt{2}$ is also a zero of $x^{3}-2 x$ and of $x^{4}-3 x^{2}+2=\left(x^{2}-2\right)\left(x^{2}-1\right)$. Both these other polynomials having $\sqrt{2}$ as a zero were multiples of $x^{2}-2$. The next theorem shows that this is an illustration of a general situation. This theorem plays a central role in our later work.

29.13 Theorem Let $E$ be an extension field of $F$, and let $\alpha \in E$, where $\alpha$ is algebraic over $F$. Then there is an irreducible polynomial $p(x) \in F[x]$ such that $p(\alpha)=0$. This irreducible polynomial $p(x)$ is uniquely determined up to a constant factor in $F$ and is a polynomial of minimal degree $\geq 1$ in $F[x]$ having $\alpha$ as a zero. If $f(\alpha)=0$ for $f(x) \in F[x]$, with $f(x) \neq 0$, then $p(x)$ divides $f(x)$.

Proof Let $\phi_{\alpha}$ be the evaluation homomorphism of $F[x]$ into $E$, given by Theorem 22.4. The kernel of $\phi_{\alpha}$ is an ideal and by Theorem 27.24 it must be a principal ideal generated by some $p(x) \in F[x]$. Now $\langle p(x)\rangle$ consists precisely of those elements of $F[x]$ having $\alpha$ as a zero. Thus, if $f(\alpha)=0$ for $f(x) \neq 0$, then $f(x) \in\langle p(x)\rangle$, so $p(x)$ divides $f(x)$. Thus $p(x)$ is a polynomial of minimal degree $\geq 1$ having $\alpha$ as a zero, and any other such polynomial of the same degree as $p(x)$ must be of the form $(a) p(x)$ for some $a \in F$.

It only remains for us to show that $p(x)$ is irreducible. If $p(x)=r(x) s(x)$ were a factorization of $p(x)$ into polynomials of lower degree, then $p(\alpha)=0$ would imply that $r(\alpha) s(\alpha)=0$, so either $r(\alpha)=0$ or $s(\alpha)=0$, since $E$ is a field. This would contradict the fact that $p(x)$ is of minimal degree $\geq 1$ such that $p(\alpha)=0$. Thus $p(x)$ is irreducible.

By multiplying by a suitable constant in $F$, we can assume that the coefficient of the highest power of $x$ appearing in $p(x)$ of Theorem 29.13 is 1 . Such a polynomial having 1 as the coefficient of the highest power of $x$ appearing is a monic polynomial.

29.14 Definition Let $E$ be an extension field of a field $F$, and let $\alpha \in E$ be algebraic over $F$. The unique monic polynomial $p(x)$ having the property described in Theorem 29.13 is the irreducible polynomial for $\alpha$ over $F$ and will be denoted by $\operatorname{irr}(\alpha, F)$. The degree of $\operatorname{irr}(\alpha, F)$ is the degree of $\alpha$ over $F$, denoted by $\operatorname{deg}(\alpha, F)$.

29.15 Example We know that $\operatorname{irr}(\sqrt{2}, \mathbb{Q})=x^{2}-2$. Referring to Example 29.10, we see that for $\alpha=$ $\sqrt{1+\sqrt{3}}$ in $\mathbb{R}, \alpha$ is a zero of $x^{4}-2 x^{2}-2$, which is in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$. Since $x^{4}-2 x^{2}-2$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$ (by Eisenstein with $p=2$, or by application of the technique of Example 23.14), we see that

$$
\operatorname{irr}(\sqrt{1+\sqrt{3}}, \mathbb{Q})=x^{4}-2 x^{2}-2 .
$$

Thus $\sqrt{1+\sqrt{3}}$ is algebraic of degree 4 over $\mathbb{Q}$.

Just as we must speak of an element $\alpha$ as algebraic over $F$ rather than simply as algebraic, we must speak of the degree of $\alpha$ over $F$ rather than the degree of $\alpha$. To take a trivial illustration, $\sqrt{2} \in \mathbb{R}$ is algebraic of degree 2 over $\mathbb{Q}$ but algebraic of degree 1 over $\mathbb{R}$, for $\operatorname{irr}(\sqrt{2}, \mathbb{R})=x-\sqrt{2}$.

The quick development of the theory here is due to the machinery of homomorphisms and ideal theory that we now have at our disposal. Note especially our constant use of the evaluation homomorphisms $\phi_{\alpha}$.

## Simple Extensions

Let $E$ be an extension field of a field $F$, and let $\alpha \in E$. Let $\phi_{\alpha}$ be the evaluation homomorphism of $F[x]$ into $E$ with $\phi_{\alpha}(a)=a$ for $a \in F$ and $\phi_{\alpha}(x)=\alpha$, as in Theorem 22.4. We consider two cases.

Case I Suppose $\alpha$ is algebraic over $F$. Then as in Theorem 29.13, the kernel of $\phi_{\alpha}$ is $\langle\operatorname{irr}(\alpha, F)\rangle$ and by Theorem 27.25 , $\langle\operatorname{irr}(\alpha, F)\rangle$ is a maximal ideal of $F[x]$. Therefore, $F[x] /\langle\operatorname{irr}(\alpha, F)\rangle$ is a field and is isomorphic to the image $\phi_{\alpha}[F[x]]$ in $E$. This subfield $\phi_{\alpha}[F[x]]$ of $E$ is then the smallest subfield of $E$ containing $F$ and $\alpha$. We shall denote this field by $F(\alpha)$.

Case II Suppose $\alpha$ is transcendental over $F$. Then by Theorem 29.12, $\phi_{\alpha}$ gives an isomorphism of $F[x]$ with a subdomain of $E$. Thus in this case $\phi_{\alpha}[F[x]]$ is not a field but an integral domain that we shall denote by $F[\alpha]$. By Corollary 21.8, $E$ contains a field of quotients of $F[\alpha]$, which is thus the smallest subfield of $E$ containing $F$ and $\alpha$. As in Case $\mathrm{I}$, we denote this field by $F(\alpha)$.

29.16 Example Since $\pi$ is transcendental over $\mathbb{Q}$, the field $\mathbb{Q}(\pi)$ is isomorphic to the field $\mathbb{Q}(x)$ of rational functions over $\mathbb{Q}$ in the indeterminate $x$. Thus from a structural viewpoint, an element that is transcendental over a field $F$ behaves as though it were an indeterminate over $F$.

29.17 Definition An extension field $E$ of a field $F$ is a simple extension of $F$ if $E=F(\alpha)$ for some $\alpha \in E$.

Many important results appear throughout this section. We have now developed so much machinery that results are starting to pour out of our efficient plant at an alarming rate. The next theorem gives us insight into the nature of the field $F(\alpha)$ in the case where $\alpha$ is algebraic over $F$.

29.18 Theorem Let $E$ be a simple extension $F(\alpha)$ of a field $F$, and let $\alpha$ be algebraic over $F$. Let the degree of $\operatorname{irr}(\alpha, F)$ be $n \geq 1$. Then every element $\beta$ of $E=F(\alpha)$ can be uniquely expressed in the form

$$
\beta=b_{0}+b_{1} \alpha+\cdots+b_{n-1} \alpha^{n-1},
$$

where the $b_{i}$ are in $F$.

Proof For the usual evaluation homomorphism $\phi_{\alpha}$, every element of

$$
F(\alpha)=\phi_{\alpha}[F[x]]
$$

is of the form $\phi_{\alpha}(f(x))=f(\alpha)$, a formal polynomial in $\alpha$ with coefficients in $F$. Let

$$
\operatorname{irr}(\alpha, F)=p(x)=x^{n}+a_{n-1} x^{n-1}+\cdots+a_{0} .
$$

Then $p(\alpha)=0$, so

$$
\alpha^{n}=-a_{n-1} \alpha^{n-1}-\cdots-a_{0} .
$$

This equation in $F(\alpha)$ can be used to express every monomial $\alpha^{m}$ for $m \geq n$ in terms of powers of $\alpha$ that are less than $n$. For example,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\alpha^{n+1} & =\alpha \alpha^{n}=-a_{n-1} \alpha^{n}-a_{n-2} \alpha^{n-1}-\cdots-a_{0} \alpha \\
& =-a_{n-1}\left(-a_{n-1} \alpha^{n-1}-\cdots-a_{0}\right)-a_{n-2} \alpha^{n-1}-\cdots-a_{0} \alpha .
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, if $\beta \in F(\alpha), \beta$ can be expressed in the required form

$$
\beta=b_{0}+b_{1} \alpha+\cdots+b_{n-1} \alpha^{n-1} .
$$

For uniqueness, if

$$
b_{0}+b_{1} \alpha+\cdots+b_{n-1} \alpha^{n-1}=b_{0}^{\prime}+b_{1}^{\prime} \alpha+\cdots+b_{n-1}^{\prime} \alpha^{n-1}
$$

for $b_{i}^{\prime} \in F$, then

$$
\left(b_{0}-b_{0}^{\prime}\right)+\left(b_{1}-b_{1}^{\prime}\right) x+\cdots+\left(b_{n-1}-b_{n-1}^{\prime}\right) x^{n-1}=g(x)
$$

is in $F[x]$ and $g(\alpha)=0$. Also, the degree of $g(x)$ is less than the degree of $\operatorname{irr}(\alpha, F)$. Since $\operatorname{irr}(\alpha, F)$ is a nonzero polynomial of minimal degree in $F[x]$ having $\alpha$ as a zero, we must have $g(x)=0$. Therefore, $b_{i}-b_{i}^{\prime}=0$, so

$$
b_{i}=b_{i}^{\prime},
$$

and the uniqueness of the $b_{i}$ is established.

We give an impressive example illustrating Theorem 29.18.

The polynomial $p(x)=x^{2}+x+1$ in $\mathbb{Z}_{2}[x]$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ by Theorem 23.10, since neither element 0 nor element 1 of $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ is a zero of $p(x)$. By Theorem 29.3, we know that there is an extension field $E$ of $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ containing a zero $\alpha$ of $x^{2}+x+1$. By Theorem 29.18, $\mathbb{Z}_{2}(\alpha)$ has as elements $0+0 \alpha, 1+0 \alpha, 0+1 \alpha$, and $1+1 \alpha$, that is, 0 , $1, \alpha$, and $1+\alpha$. This gives us a new finite field, of four elements! The addition and multiplication tables for this field are shown in Tables 29.20 and 29.21. For example, to compute $(1+\alpha)(1+\alpha)$ in $\mathbb{Z}_{2}(\alpha)$, we observe that since $p(\alpha)=\alpha^{2}+\alpha+1=0$, then

$$
\alpha^{2}=-\alpha-1=\alpha+1
$$

Therefore,

$$
(1+\alpha)(1+\alpha)=1+\alpha+\alpha+\alpha^{2}=1+\alpha^{2}=1+\alpha+1=\alpha
$$

Finally, we can use Theorem 29.18 to fulfill our promise of Example 29.4 and show that $\mathbb{R}[x] /\left\langle x^{2}+1\right\rangle$ is isomorphic to the field $\mathbb{C}$ of complex numbers. We saw in Example 29.4 that we can view $\mathbb{R}[x] /\left\langle x^{2}+1\right\rangle$ as an extension field of $\mathbb{R}$. Let

$$
\alpha=x+\left\langle x^{2}+1\right\rangle \text {. }
$$

Then $\mathbb{R}(\alpha)=\mathbb{R}[x] /\left\langle x^{2}+1\right\rangle$ and consists of all elements of the form $a+b \alpha$ for $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$, by Theorem 29.18. But since $\alpha^{2}+1=0$, we see that $\alpha$ plays the role of $i \in \mathbb{C}$, and $a+b \alpha$ plays the role of $(a+b i) \in \mathbb{C}$. Thus $\mathbb{R}(\alpha) \simeq \mathbb{C}$. This is the elegant algebraic way to construct $\mathbb{C}$ from $\mathbb{R}$.

## SECTION 30 Vector Spaces

The notions of a vector space, scalars, independent vectors, and bases may be familiar. In this section, we present these ideas where the scalars may be elements of any field. We use Greek letters like $\alpha$ and $\beta$ for vectors since, in our application, the vectors will be elements of an extension field $E$ of a field $F$. The proofs are all identical with those often given in a first course in linear algebra. If these ideas are familiar, we suggest studying Examples 30.4, 30.8, 30.11, 30.14, and 30.22, and then reading Theorem 30.23 and its proof. If the examples and the theorem are understood, then do some exercises and proceed to the next section.

## Definition and Elementary Properties

The topic of vector spaces is the cornerstone of linear algebra. Since linear algebra is not the subject for study in this text, our treatment of vector spaces will be brief, designed to develop only the concepts of linear independence and dimension that we need for our field theory.

The terms vector and scalar are probably familiar from calculus. Here we allow scalars to be elements of any field, not just the real numbers, and develop the theory by axioms just as for the other algebraic structures we have studied.

30.1 Definition Let $F$ be a field. A vector space over $F$ (or $F$-vector space) consists of an abelian group $V$ under addition together with an operation of scalar multiplication of each element of $V$ by each element of $F$ on the left, such that for all $a, b \in F$ and $\alpha, \beta \in V$ the following
conditions are satisfied:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathscr{T}_{1}: a \alpha \in V . \\
& \mathscr{T}_{2}: a(b \alpha)=(a b) \alpha . \\
& \mathscr{T}_{3} \cdot(a+b) \alpha=(a \alpha)+(b \alpha) . \\
& \mathscr{T}_{4} \cdot a(\alpha+\beta)=(a \alpha)+(a \beta) . \\
& \mathscr{T}_{5} \cdot 1 \alpha=\alpha .
\end{aligned}
$$

The elements of $V$ are vectors and the elements of $F$ are scalars. When only one field $F$ is under discussion, we drop the reference to $F$ and refer to a vector space.

Note that scalar multiplication for a vector space is not a binary operation on one set in the sense we defined it in Section 2. It associates an element $a \alpha$ of $V$ with each ordered pair $(a, \alpha)$, consisting of an element $a$ of $F$ and an element $\alpha$ of $V$. Thus scalar multiplication is a function mapping $F \times V$ into $V$. Both the additive identity for $V$, the 0 -vector, and the additive identity for $F$, the 0 -scalar, will be denoted by 0 .

30.2 Example Consider the abelian group $\left\langle\mathbb{R}_{n},+\right\rangle=\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \times \cdots \times \mathbb{R}$ for $n$ factors, which consists of ordered $n$-tuples under addition by components. Define scalar multiplication for scalars in $\mathbb{R}$ by

$$
r \alpha=\left(r a_{1}, \cdots, r a_{n}\right)
$$

## Historical Note

$\mathrm{T}$ The ideas behind the abstract notion of a vector space occurred in many concrete examples during the nineteenth century and earlier. For example, William Rowan Hamilton dealt with complex numbers explicitly as pairs of real numbers and, as noted in Section 24, also dealt with triples and eventually quadruples of real numbers in his invention of the quaternions. In these cases, the "vectors" turned out to be objects which could both be added and multiplied by scalars, using "reasonable" rules for both of these operations. Other examples of such objects included differential forms (expressions under integral signs) and algebraic integers.

Although Hermann Grassmann (1809-1877) succeeded in working out a detailed theory of $n$ dimensional spaces in his Die Lineale Ausdehnungslehre of 1844 and 1862, the first mathematician to give an abstract definition of a vector space equivalent to Definition 30.1 was Giuseppe Peano (1858-1932) in his Calcolo Geometrico of 1888. Peano's aim in the book, as the title indicates, was to develop a geometric calculus. According to Peano, such a calculus "consists of a system of operations analogous to those of algebraic calculus, but in which the objects with which the calculations are performed are, instead of numbers, geometrical objects." Curiously, Peano's work had no immediate effect on the mathematical scene. Although Hermann Weyl (1885-1955) essentially repeated Peano's definition in his Space-Time-Matter of 1918, the definition of a vector space did not enter the mathematical mainstream until it was announced for a third time by Stefan Banach (18921945) in the 1922 publication of his dissertation dealing with what we now call Banach spaces, complete normed vector spaces.
for $r \in \mathbb{R}$ and $\alpha=\left(a_{1}, \cdots, a_{n}\right) \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$. With these operations, $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ becomes a vector space over $\mathbb{R}$. The axioms for a vector space are readily checked. In particular, $\mathbb{R}^{2}=\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$ as a vector space over $\mathbb{R}$ can be viewed as all "vectors whose starting points are the origin of the Euclidean plane" in the sense often studied in calculus courses.

30.3 Example For any field $F, F[x]$ can be viewed as a vector space over $F$, where addition of vectors is ordinary addition of polynomials in $F[x]$ and scalar multiplication $a \alpha$ of an element of $F[x]$ by an element of $F$ is ordinary multiplication in $F[x]$. The axioms $\mathscr{T}_{1}$ through $\mathscr{T}_{5}$ for a vector space then follow immediately from the fact that $F[x]$ is a ring with unity.

30.4 Example Let $E$ be an extension field of a field $F$. Then $E$ can be regarded as a vector space over $F$, where addition of vectors is the usual addition in $E$ and scalar multiplication $a \alpha$ is the usual field multiplication in $E$ with $a \in F$ and $\alpha \in E$. The axioms follow at once from the field axioms for $E$. Here our field of scalars is actually a subset of our space of vectors. It is this example that is the important one for us.

We are assuming nothing about vector spaces from previous work and shall prove everything we need from the definition, even though the results may be familiar from calculus.

30.5 Theorem If $V$ is a vector space over $F$, then $0 \alpha=0, a 0=0$ and $(-a) \alpha=a(-\alpha)=-(a \alpha)$ for all $a \in F$ and $\alpha \in V$.

Proof The equation $0 \alpha=0$ is to be read " $(0$-scalar $) \alpha=0$-vector." Likewise, $a 0=0$ is to be read " $a(0$-vector $)=0$-vector." The proofs here are very similar to those in Theorem 18.8 for a ring and again depend heavily on the distributive laws $\mathscr{T}_{3}$ and $\mathscr{T}_{4}$. Now

$$
(0 \alpha)=(0+0) \alpha=(0 \alpha)+(0 \alpha)
$$

is an equation in the abelian group $\langle V,+\rangle$, so by the group cancellation law, $0=0 \alpha$. Likewise, from

$$
a 0=a(0+0)=a 0+a 0
$$

we conclude that $a 0=0$. Then

$$
0=0 \alpha=(a+(-a)) \alpha=a \alpha+(-a) \alpha
$$

so $(-a) \alpha=-(a \alpha)$. Likewise, from

$$
0=a 0=a(\alpha+(-\alpha))=a \alpha+a(-\alpha),
$$

we conclude that $a(-\alpha)=-(a \alpha)$ also.

## Linear Independence and Bases

30.6 Definition Let $V$ be a vector space over $F$. The vectors in a subset $S=\left\{\alpha_{i} \mid i \in I\right\}$ of $V$ span (or generate) $V$ if for every $\beta \in V$, we have

$$
\beta=a_{1} \alpha_{i_{1}}+a_{2} \alpha_{i_{2}}+\cdots+a_{n} \alpha_{i_{n}}
$$

for some $a_{j} \in F$ and $\alpha_{i_{j}} \in S, j=1, \cdots, n$. A vector $\sum_{j=1}^{n} a_{j} \alpha_{i_{j}}$ is a linear combination of the $\alpha_{i_{j}}$.

30.7 Example $\quad$ In the vector space $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ over $\mathbb{R}$ of Example 30.2, the vectors

$$
(1,0, \cdots, 0),(0,1, \cdots, 0), \cdots,(0,0, \cdots, 1)
$$

clearly span $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, for

$$
\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \cdots, a_{n}\right)=a_{1}(1,0, \cdots, 0)+a_{2}(0,1, \cdots, 0)+\cdots+a_{n}(0,0, \cdots, 1) .
$$

Also, the monomials $x^{m}$ for $m \geq 0$ span $F[x]$ over $F$, the vector space of Example 30.3.

30.8 Example Let $F$ be a field and $E$ an extension field of $F$. Let $\alpha \in E$ be algebraic over $F$. Then $F(\alpha)$ is a vector space over $F$ and by Theorem 29.18 , it is spanned by the vectors in $\left\{1, \alpha, \cdots, \alpha^{n-1}\right\}$, where $n=\operatorname{deg}(\alpha, F)$. This is the important example for us.

30.9 Definition A vector space $V$ over a field $F$ is finite dimensional if there is a finite subset of $V$ whose vectors span $V$.

30.10 Example Example 30.7 shows that $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is finite dimensional. The vector space $F[x]$ over $F$ is not finite dimensional, since polynomials of arbitrarily large degree could not be linear combinations of elements of any finite set of polynomials.

30.11 Example If $F \leq E$ and $\alpha \in E$ is algebraic over the field $F$, Example 30.8 shows that $F(\alpha)$ is a finite-dimensional vector space over $F$. This is the most important example for us.

The next definition contains the most important idea in this section.

30.12 Definition The vectors in a subset $S=\left\{\alpha_{i} \mid i \in I\right\}$ of a vector space $V$ over a field $F$ are linearly independent over $F$ if, for any distinct vectors $\alpha_{i_{j}} \in S$, coefficients $a_{j} \in F$ and $n \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}$, we have $\sum_{j=1}^{n} a_{j} \alpha_{i_{j}}=0$ in $V$ only if $a_{j}=0$ for $j=1, \cdots, n$. If the vectors are not linearly independent over $F$, they are linearly dependent over $F$.

Thus the vectors in $\left\{\alpha_{i} \mid i \in I\right\}$ are linearly independent over $F$ if the only way the 0 -vector can be expressed as a linear combination of the vectors $\alpha_{i}$ is to have all scalar coefficients equal to 0 . If the vectors are linearly dependent over $F$, then there exist $a_{j} \in F$ for $j=1, \cdots, n$ such that $\sum_{j=1}^{n} a_{j} \alpha_{i_{j}}=0$, where not all $a_{j}=0$.

30.13 Example Observe that the vectors spanning the space $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ that are given in Example 30.7 are linearly independent over $\mathbb{R}$. Likewise, the vectors in $\left\{x^{m} \mid m \geq 0\right\}$ are linearly independent vectors of $F[x]$ over $F$. Note that $(1,-1),(2,1)$, and $(-3,2)$ are linearly dependent in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ over $\mathbb{R}$, since

$$
7(1,-1)+(2,1)+3(-3,2)=(0,0)=0 .
$$

30.14 Example $\quad$ Let $E$ be an extension field of a field $F$, and let $\alpha \in E$ be algebraic over $F$. If $\operatorname{deg}(\alpha, F)=$ $n$, then by Theorem 29.18, every element of $F(\alpha)$ can be uniquely expressed in the form

$$
b_{0}+b_{1} \alpha+\cdots+b_{n-1} \alpha^{n-1}
$$

for $b_{i} \in F$. In particular, $0=0+0 \alpha+\cdots+0 \alpha^{n-1}$ must be a unique such expression for 0 . Thus the elements $1, \alpha, \cdots, \alpha^{n-1}$ are linearly independent vectors in $F(\alpha)$ over
the field $F$. They also span $F(\alpha)$, so by the next definition, $1, \alpha, \cdots, \alpha^{n-1}$ form a basis for $F(\alpha)$ over $F$. This is the important example for us. In fact, this is the reason we are doing this material on vector spaces.

30.15 Definition If $V$ is a vector space over a field $F$, the vectors in a subset $B=\left\{\beta_{i} \mid i \in I\right\}$ of $V$ form a basis for $V$ over $F$ if they span $V$ and are linearly independent.

## Dimension

The only other results we wish to prove about vector spaces are that every finitedimensional vector space has a basis, and that any two bases of a finite-dimensional vector space have the same number of elements. Both these facts are true without the assumption that the vector space is finite dimensional, but the proofs require more knowledge of set theory than we are assuming, and the finite-dimensional case is all we need. First we give an easy lemma.

30.16 Lemma Let $V$ be a vector space over a field $F$, and let $\alpha \in V$. If $\alpha$ is a linear combination of vectors $\beta_{i}$ in $V$ for $i=1, \cdots, m$ and each $\beta_{i}$ is a linear combination of vectors $\gamma_{j}$ in $V$ for $j=1, \cdots, n$, then $\alpha$ is a linear combination of the $\gamma_{j}$.

Proof Let $\alpha=\sum_{i=1}^{m} a_{i} \beta_{i}$, and let $\beta_{i}=\sum_{j=1}^{n} b_{i j} \gamma_{j}$, where $a_{i}$ and $b_{i j}$ are in $F$. Then

$$
\alpha=\sum_{i=1}^{m} a_{i}\left(\sum_{j=1}^{n} b_{i j} \gamma_{j}\right)=\sum_{j=1}^{n}\left(\sum_{i=1}^{m} a_{i} b_{i j}\right) \gamma_{j}
$$

and $\left(\sum_{i=1}^{m} a_{i} b_{i j}\right) \in F$.

30.17 Theorem In a finite-dimensional vector space, every finite set of vectors spanning the space contains a subset that is a basis.

Proof Let $V$ be finite dimensional over $F$, and let vectors $\alpha_{1}, \cdots, \alpha_{n}$ in $V$ span $V$. Let us list the $\alpha_{i}$ in a row. Examine each $\alpha_{i}$ in succession, starting at the left with $i=1$, and discard the first $\alpha_{j}$ that is some linear combination of the preceding $\alpha_{i}$ for $i<j$. Then continue, starting with the following $\alpha_{j+1}$, and discard the next $\alpha_{k}$ that is some linear combination of its remaining predecessors, and so on. When we reach $\alpha_{n}$ after a finite number of steps, those $\alpha_{i}$ remaining in our list are such that none is a linear combination of the preceding $\alpha_{i}$ in this reduced list. Lemma 30.16 shows that any vector that is a linear combination of the original collection of $\alpha_{i}$ is still a linear combination of our reduced, and possibly smaller, set in which no $\alpha_{i}$ is a linear combination of its predecessors. Thus the vectors in the reduced set of $\alpha_{i}$ again span $V$.

For the reduced set, suppose that

$$
a_{1} \alpha_{i_{1}}+\cdots+a_{r} \alpha_{i_{r}}=0
$$

for $i_{1}<i_{2}<\cdots<i_{r}$ and that some $a_{j} \neq 0$. We may assume from Theorem 30.5 that $a_{r} \neq 0$, or we could drop $a_{r} \alpha_{i_{r}}$ from the left side of the equation. Then, using

Theorem 30.5 again, we obtain

$$
\alpha_{i_{r}}=\left(-\frac{a_{1}}{a_{r}}\right) \alpha_{i_{1}}+\cdots+\left(-\frac{a_{r-1}}{a_{r}}\right) \alpha_{i_{r-1}}
$$

which shows that $\alpha_{i_{r}}$ is a linear combination of its predecessors, contradicting our construction. Thus the vectors $\alpha_{i}$ in the reduced set both span $V$ and are linearly independent, so they form a basis for $V$ over $F$.

30.18 Corollary A finite-dimensional vector space has a finite basis.

Proof By definition, a finite-dimensional vector space has a finite set of vectors that span the space. Theorem 30.17 completes the proof.

The next theorem is the culmination of our work on vector spaces.

30.19 Theorem Let $S=\left\{\alpha_{1}, \cdots, \alpha_{r}\right\}$ be a finite set of linearly independent vectors of a finite-dimensional vector space $V$ over a field $F$. Then $S$ can be enlarged to a basis for $V$ over $F$. Furthermore, if $B=\left\{\beta_{1}, \cdots, \beta_{n}\right\}$ is any basis for $V$ over $F$, then $r \leq n$.

Proof By Corollary 30.18, there is a basis $B=\left\{\beta_{1}, \cdots, \beta_{n}\right\}$ for $V$ over $F$. Consider the finite sequence of vectors

$$
\alpha_{1}, \cdots, \alpha_{r}, \beta_{1}, \cdots, \beta_{n}
$$

These vectors span $V$, since $B$ is a basis. Following the technique, used in Theorem 30.17, of discarding in turn each vector that is a linear combination of its remaining predecessors, working from left to right, we arrive at a basis for $V$. Observe that no $\alpha_{i}$ is cast out, since the $\alpha_{i}$ are linearly independent. Thus $S$ can be enlarged to a basis for $V$ over $F$.

For the second part of the conclusion, consider the sequence

$$
\alpha_{1}, \beta_{1}, \cdots, \beta_{n} .
$$

These vectors are not linearly independent over $F$, because $\alpha_{1}$ is a linear combination

$$
\alpha_{1}=b_{1} \beta_{1}+\cdots+b_{n} \beta_{n},
$$

since the $\beta_{i}$ form a basis. Thus

$$
\alpha_{1}+\left(-b_{1}\right) \beta_{1}+\cdots+\left(-b_{n}\right) \beta_{n}=0 .
$$

The vectors in the sequence do span $V$, and if we form a basis by the technique of working from left to right and casting out in turn each vector that is a linear combination of its remaining predecessors, at least one $\beta_{i}$ must be cast out, giving a basis

$$
\left\{\alpha_{1}, \beta_{1}^{(1)}, \cdots, \beta_{m}^{(1)}\right\}
$$

where $m \leq n-1$. Applying the same technique to the sequence of vectors

$$
\alpha_{1}, \alpha_{2}, \beta_{1}^{(1)}, \cdots, \beta_{m}^{(1)} \text {, }
$$

we arrive at a new basis

$$
\left\{\alpha_{1}, \alpha_{2}, \beta_{1}^{(2)}, \cdots, \beta_{s}^{(2)}\right\}
$$

with $s \leq n-2$. Continuing, we arrive finally at a basis

$$
\left\{\alpha_{1}, \cdots, \alpha_{r}, \beta_{1}^{(r)}, \cdots, \beta_{t}^{(r)}\right\}
$$

where $0 \leq t \leq n-r$. Thus $r \leq n$.

30.20 Corollary Any two bases of a finite-dimensional vector space $V$ over $F$ have the same number of elements.

Proof Let $B=\left\{\beta_{1}, \cdots, \beta_{n}\right\}$ and $B^{\prime}=\left\{\beta_{1}^{\prime}, \cdots, \beta_{m}^{\prime}\right\}$ be two bases. Then by Theorem 30.19, regarding $B$ as an independent set of vectors and $B^{\prime}$ as a basis, we see that $n \leq m$. A symmetric argument gives $m \leq n$, so $m=n$.

30.21 Definition If $V$ is a finite-dimensional vector space over a field $F$, the number of elements in a basis (independent of the choice of basis, as just shown) is the dimension of $V$ over $F$.

30.22 Example $\quad$ Let $E$ be an extension field of a field $F$, and let $\alpha \in E$. Example 30.14 shows that if $\alpha$ is algebraic over $F$ and $\operatorname{deg}(\alpha, F)=n$, then the dimension of $F(\alpha)$ as a vector space over $F$ is $n$. This is the important example for us.

## An Application to Field Theory

We collect the results of field theory contained in Examples 30.4, 30.8, 30.11, 30.14, and 30.22 , and incorporate them into one theorem. The last sentence of this theorem gives an additional nice application of these vector space ideas to field theory.

30.23 Theorem Let $E$ be an extension field of $F$, and let $\alpha \in E$ be algebraic over $F$. If $\operatorname{deg}(\alpha, F)=n$, then $F(\alpha)$ is an $n$-dimensional vector space over $F$ with basis $\left\{1, \alpha, \cdots, \alpha^{n-1}\right\}$. Furthermore, every element $\beta$ of $F(\alpha)$ is algebraic over $F$, and $\operatorname{deg}(\beta, F) \leq \operatorname{deg}(\alpha, F)$.

Proof We have shown everything in the preceding examples except the very important result stated in the last sentence of the above theorem. Let $\beta \in F(\alpha)$, where $\alpha$ is algebraic over $F$ of degree $n$. Consider the elements

$$
1, \beta, \beta^{2}, \cdots, \beta^{n}
$$

These cannot be $n+1$ distinct elements of $F(\alpha)$ that are linearly independent over $F$, for by Theorem 30.19, any basis of $F(\alpha)$ over $F$ would have to contain at least as many elements as are in any set of linearly independent vectors over $F$. However, the basis $\left\{1, \alpha, \cdots, \alpha^{n-1}\right\}$ has just $n$ elements. If $\beta^{i}=\beta^{j}$, then $\beta^{i}-\beta^{j}=0$, so in any case there exist $b_{i} \in F$ such that

$$
b_{0}+b_{1} \beta+b_{2} \beta^{2}+\cdots+b_{n} \beta^{n}=0
$$

where not all $b_{i}=0$. Then $f(x)=b_{n} x^{n}+\cdots+b_{1} x+b_{0}$ is a nonzero element of $F[x]$ such that $f(\beta)=0$. Therefore, $\beta$ is algebraic over $F$ and $\operatorname{deg}(\beta, F)$ is at most $n$.

\begin{aligned}
& a_{11} X_{1}+a_{12} X_{2}+\cdots+a_{1 n} X_{n}=b_{1} \\
& a_{21} X_{1}+a_{22} X_{2}+\cdots+a_{2 n} X_{n}=b_{2} \\
& \quad \vdots \\

a. Show that the "system has a solution," that is, there exist $X_{1}, \cdots, X_{n} \in F$ that satisfy all $m$ equations, if and only if the vector $\beta=\left(b_{1}, \cdots, b_{m}\right)$ of $F^{m}$ is a linear combination of the vectors $\alpha_{j}=\left(a_{1 j}, \cdots, a_{m j}\right)$. (This result is straightforward to prove, being practically the definition of a solution, but should really be regarded as the fundamental existence theorem for a simultaneous solution of a system of linear equations.)

b. From part (a), show that if $n=m$ and $\left\{\alpha_{j} \mid j=1, \cdots, n\right\}$ is a basis for $F^{n}$, then the system always has a unique solution.

a. Show that $\phi[V]$ is a subspace of $V^{\prime}$.

## section 31 Algebraic Extensions

## Finite Extensions

In Theorem 30.23 we saw that if $E$ is an extension field of a field $F$ and $\alpha \in E$ is algebraic over $F$, then every element of $F(\alpha)$ is algebraic over $F$. In studying zeros of polynomials in $F[x]$, we shall be interested almost exclusively in extensions of $F$ containing only elements algebraic over $F$.

31.1 Definition An extension field $E$ of a field $F$ is an algebraic extension of $F$ if every element in $E$ is algebraic over $F$.

31.2 Definition If an extension field $E$ of a field $F$ is of finite dimension $n$ as a vector space over $F$, then $E$ is a finite extension of degree $n$ over $F$. We shall let $[E: F]$ be the degree $n$ of $E$ over $F$.

To say that a field $E$ is a finite extension of a field $F$ does not mean that $E$ is a finite field. It just asserts that $E$ is a finite-dimensional vector space over $F$, that is, that $[E: F]$ is finite.

We shall often use the fact that if $E$ is a finite extension of $F$, then, $[E: F]=1$ if and only if $E=F$. We need only observe that by Theorem $30.19,\{1\}$ can always be enlarged to a basis for $E$ over $F$. Thus $[E: F]=1$ if and only if $E=F(1)=F$.

Let us repeat the argument of Theorem 30.23 to show that a finite extension $E$ of a field $F$ must be an algebraic extension of $F$.

31.3 Theorem A finite extension field $E$ of a field $F$ is an algebraic extension of $F$.

Proof We must show that for $\alpha \in E, \alpha$ is algebraic over $F$. By Theorem 30.19 if $[E: F]=n$, then

$$
1, \alpha, \cdots, \alpha^{n}
$$

cannot be linearly independent elements, so there exist $a_{i} \in F$ such that

$$
a_{n} \alpha^{n}+\cdots+a_{1} \alpha+a_{0}=0
$$

and not all $a_{i}=0$. Then $f(x)=a_{n} x^{n}+\cdots+a_{1} x+a_{0}$ is a nonzero polynomial in $F[x]$, and $f(\alpha)=0$. Therefore, $\alpha$ is algebraic over $F$.

We cannot overemphasize the importance of our next theorem. It plays a role in field theory analogous to the role of the theorem of Lagrange in group theory. While its proof follows easily from our brief work with vector spaces, it is a tool of incredible power. An elegant application of it in the section that follows shows the impossibility of performing certain geometric constructions with a straightedge and a compass. Never underestimate a theorem that counts something.

31.4 Theorem If $E$ is a finite extension field of a field $F$, and $K$ is a finite extension field of $E$, then $K$ is a finite extension of $F$, and

$$
[K: F]=[K: E][E: F]
$$

31.5 Figure

Proof Let $\left\{\alpha_{i} \mid i=1, \cdots, n\right\}$ be a basis for $E$ as a vector space over $F$, and let the set $\left\{\beta_{j} \mid j=1, \cdots, m\right\}$ be a basis for $K$ as a vector space over $E$. The theorem will be proved if we can show that the $m n$ elements $\alpha_{i} \beta_{j}$ form a basis for $K$, viewed as a vector space over $F$. (See Fig. 31.5.)

Let $\gamma$ be any element of $K$. Since the $\beta_{j}$ form a basis for $K$ over $E$, we have

$$
\gamma=\sum_{j=1}^{m} b_{j} \beta_{j}
$$

for $b_{j} \in E$. Since the $\alpha_{i}$ form a basis for $E$ over $F$, we have

$$
b_{j}=\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i j} \alpha_{i}
$$

for $a_{i j} \in F$. Then

$$
\gamma=\sum_{j=1}^{m}\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i j} \alpha_{i}\right) \beta_{j}=\sum_{i, j} a_{i j}\left(\alpha_{i} \beta_{j}\right)
$$

so the $m n$ vectors $\alpha_{i} \beta_{j}$ span $K$ over $F$.

It remains for us to show that the $m n$ elements $\alpha_{i} \beta_{j}$ are independent over $F$. Suppose that $\Sigma_{i, j} c_{i j}\left(\alpha_{i} \beta_{j}\right)=0$, with $c_{i j} \in F$. Then

$$
\sum_{j=1}^{m}\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} c_{i j} \alpha_{i}\right) \beta_{j}=0
$$

and $\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} c_{i j} \alpha_{i}\right) \in E$. Since the elements $\beta_{j}$ are independent over $E$, we must have

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{n} c_{i j} \alpha_{i}=0
$$

for all $j$. But now the $\alpha_{i}$ are independent over $F$, so $\sum_{i=1}^{n} c_{i j} \alpha_{i}=0$ implies that $c_{i j}=0$ for all $i$ and $j$. Thus the $\alpha_{i} \beta_{j}$ not only span $K$ over $F$ but also are independent over $F$. Thus they form a basis for $K$ over $F$.

Note that we proved this theorem by actually exhibiting a basis. It is worth remembering that if $\left\{\alpha_{i} \mid i=1, \cdots, n\right\}$ is a basis for $E$ over $F$ and $\left\{\beta_{j} \mid j=1, \cdots, m\right\}$ is a basis for $K$ over $E$, for fields $F \leq E \leq K$, then the set $\left\{\alpha_{i} \beta_{j}\right\}$ of $m n$ products is a basis for $K$ over $F$. Figure 31.5 gives a diagram for this situation. We shall illustrate this further in a moment.

31.6 Corollary If $F_{i}$ is a field for $i=1, \cdots, r$ and $F_{i+1}$ is a finite extension of $F_{i}$, then $F_{r}$ is a finite extension of $F_{1}$, and

$$
\left[F_{r}: F_{1}\right]=\left[F_{r}: F_{r-1}\right]\left[F_{r-1}: F_{r-2}\right] \cdots\left[F_{2}: F_{1}\right] .
$$

Proof The proof is a straightforward extension of Theorem 31.4 by induction.

31.7 Corollary If $E$ is an extension field of $F, \alpha \in E$ is algebraic over $F$, and $\beta \in F(\alpha)$, then $\operatorname{deg}(\beta, F)$ divides $\operatorname{deg}(\alpha, F)$.

Proof By Theorem 30.23, $\operatorname{deg}(\alpha, F)=[F(\alpha): F]$ and $\operatorname{deg}(\beta, F)=[F(\beta): F]$. We have $F \leq$ $F(\beta) \leq F(\alpha)$, so by Theorem $31.4[F(\beta): F]$ divides $[F(\alpha): F]$.

The following example illustrates a type of argument one often makes using Theorem 31.4 or its corollaries.

31.8 Example

By Corollary 31.7 , there is no element of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})$ that is a zero of $x^{3}-2$. Note that $\operatorname{deg}(\sqrt{2}, \mathbb{Q})=2$, while a zero of $x^{3}-2$ is of degree 3 over $\mathbb{Q}$, but 3 does not divide 2 .

Let $E$ be an extension field of a field $F$, and let $\alpha_{1}, \alpha_{2}$ be elements of $E$, not necessarily algebraic over $F$. By definition, $F\left(\alpha_{1}\right)$ is the smallest extension field of $F$ in $E$ that contains $\alpha_{1}$. Similarly, $\left(F\left(\alpha_{1}\right)\right)\left(\alpha_{2}\right)$ can be characterized as the smallest extension field of $F$ in $E$ containing both $\alpha_{1}$ and $\alpha_{2}$. We could equally have started with $\alpha_{2}$, so $\left(F\left(\alpha_{1}\right)\right)\left(\alpha_{2}\right)=\left(F\left(\alpha_{2}\right)\right)\left(\alpha_{1}\right)$. We denote this field by $F\left(\alpha_{1}, \alpha_{2}\right)$. Similarly, for $\alpha_{i} \in E, F\left(\alpha_{1}, \cdots \alpha_{n}\right)$ is the smallest extension field of $F$ in $E$ containing all the $\alpha_{i}$ for $i=1, \cdots, n$. We obtain the field $F\left(\alpha_{1}, \cdots, \alpha_{n}\right)$ from the field $F$ by adjoining to $F$ the elements $\alpha_{i}$ in $E$. Exercise 49 of Section 18 shows that, analogous to an intersection of subgroups of a group, an intersection of subfields of a field $E$ is again a subfield of $E$. Thus $F\left(\alpha_{1}, \cdots, \alpha_{n}\right)$ can be characterized as the intersection of all subfields of $E$ containing $F$ and all the $\alpha_{i}$ for $i=1, \cdots, n$.

31.9 Example Consider $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})$. Theorem 30.23 shows that $\{1, \sqrt{2}\}$ is a basis for $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})$ over $\mathbb{Q}$. Using the technique demonstrated in Example 29.10, we can easily discover that $\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{3}$ is a zero of $x^{4}-10 x^{2}+1$. By the method demonstrated in Example 23.14, we can show that this polynomial is irreducible in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$. Thus $\operatorname{irr}(\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{3}, \mathbb{Q})=x^{4}-10 x^{2}+1$, so $[\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{3}): \mathbb{Q}]=4$. Thus $(\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{3}) \notin \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})$, so $\sqrt{3} \notin \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})$. Consequently, $\{1, \sqrt{3}\}$ is a basis for $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3})=(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}))(\sqrt{3})$ over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})$. The proof of Theorem 31.4 (see the comment following the theorem) then shows that $\{1, \sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}, \sqrt{6}\}$ is a basis for $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3})$ over $\mathbb{Q}$.

31.10 Example Let $2^{1 / 3}$ be the real cube root of 2 and $2^{1 / 2}$ be the positive square root of 2 . Then $2^{1 / 2} \notin \mathbb{Q}\left(2^{1 / 3}\right)$ because $\operatorname{deg}\left(2^{1 / 2}, \mathbb{Q}\right)=2$ and 2 is not a divisor of $3=\operatorname{deg}\left(2^{1 / 3}, \mathbb{Q}\right)$. Thus $\left[\mathbb{Q}\left(2^{1 / 3}, 2^{1 / 2}\right): \mathbb{Q}\left(2^{1 / 3}\right)\right]=2$. Hence $\left\{1,2^{1 / 3}, 2^{2 / 3}\right\}$ is a basis for $\mathbb{Q}\left(2^{1 / 3}\right)$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ and $\left\{1,2^{1 / 2}\right\}$ is a basis for $\mathbb{Q}\left(2^{1 / 3}, 2^{1 / 2}\right)$ over $\mathbb{Q}\left(2^{1 / 3}\right)$. Furthermore, by Theorem 31.4 (see the comment following the theorem),

$$
\left\{1,2^{1 / 2}, 2^{1 / 3}, 2^{5 / 6}, 2^{2 / 3}, 2^{7 / 6}\right\}
$$

is a basis for $\mathbb{Q}\left(2^{1 / 2}, 2^{1 / 3}\right)$ over $\mathbb{Q}$. Because $2^{7 / 6}=2\left(2^{1 / 6}\right)$, we have $2^{1 / 6} \in \mathbb{Q}\left(2^{1 / 2}, 2^{1 / 3}\right)$. Now $2^{1 / 6}$ is a zero of $x^{6}-2$, which is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$, by Eisenstein's criterion, with
$p=2$. Thus

$$
\mathbb{Q} \leq \mathbb{Q}\left(2^{1 / 6}\right) \leq \mathbb{Q}\left(2^{1 / 2}, 2^{1 / 3}\right)
$$

and by Theorem 31.4

$$
\begin{aligned}
6 & =\left[\mathbb{Q}\left(2^{1 / 2}, 2^{1 / 3}\right): \mathbb{Q}\right]=\left[\mathbb{Q}\left(2^{1 / 2}, 2^{1 / 3}\right): \mathbb{Q}\left(2^{1 / 6}\right)\right]\left[\mathbb{Q}\left(2^{1 / 6}\right): \mathbb{Q}\right] \\
& =\left[\mathbb{Q}\left(2^{1 / 2}, 2^{1 / 3}\right): \mathbb{Q}\left(2^{1 / 6}\right)\right](6) .
\end{aligned}
$$

Therefore, we must have

$$
\left[\mathbb{Q}\left(2^{1 / 2}, 2^{1 / 3}\right): \mathbb{Q}\left(2^{1 / 6}\right)\right]=1,
$$

so $\mathbb{Q}\left(2^{1 / 2}, 2^{1 / 3}\right)=\mathbb{Q}\left(2^{1 / 6}\right)$, by the comment preceding Theorem 31.3.

Example 31.10 shows that it is possible for an extension $F\left(\alpha_{1}, \cdots, \alpha_{n}\right)$ of a field $F$ to be actually a simple extension, even though $n>1$.

Let us characterize extensions of $F$ of the form $F\left(\alpha_{1}, \cdots, \alpha_{n}\right)$ in the case that all the $\alpha_{i}$ are algebraic over $F$.

31.11 Theorem Let $E$ be an algebraic extension of a field $F$. Then there exist a finite number of elements $\alpha_{1}, \cdots, \alpha_{n}$ in $E$ such that $E=F\left(\alpha_{1}, \cdots, \alpha_{n}\right)$ if and only if $E$ is a finite-dimensional vector space over $F$, that is, if and only if $E$ is a finite extension of $F$.

Proof Suppose that $E=F\left(\alpha_{1}, \cdots, \alpha_{n}\right)$. Since $E$ is an algebraic extension of $F$, each $\alpha_{i}$, is algebraic over $F$, so each $\alpha_{i}$ is algebraic over every extension field of $F$ in $E$. Thus $F\left(\alpha_{1}\right)$ is algebraic over $F$, and in general, $F\left(\alpha_{1}, \cdots, \alpha_{j}\right)$ is algebraic over $F\left(\alpha_{i}, \cdots, \alpha_{j-1}\right)$ for $j=2, \cdots, n$. Corollary 31.6 applied to the sequence of finite extensions

$$
F, F\left(\alpha_{1}\right), F\left(\alpha_{1}, \alpha_{2}\right), \cdots, F\left(\alpha_{1}, \cdots, \alpha_{n}\right)=E
$$

then shows that $E$ is a finite extension of $F$.

Conversely, suppose that $E$ is a finite algebraic extension of $F$. If $[E: F]=1$, then $E=F(1)=F$, and we are done. If $E \neq F$, let $\alpha_{1} \in E$, where $\alpha_{1} \notin F$. Then $\left[F\left(\alpha_{1}\right): F\right]>1$. If $F\left(\alpha_{1}\right)=E$, we are done; if not, let $\alpha_{2} \in E$, where $\alpha_{2} \notin F\left(\alpha_{1}\right)$. Continuing this process, we see from Theorem 31.4 that since $[E: F]$ is finite, we must arrive at $\alpha_{n}$ such that

$$
F\left(\alpha_{1}, \cdots, \alpha_{n}\right)=E .
$$

## Algebraically Closed Fields and Algebraic Closures

We have not yet observed that if $E$ is an extension of a field $F$ and $\alpha, \beta \in E$ are algebraic over $F$, then so are $\alpha+\beta, \alpha \beta, \alpha-\beta$, and $\alpha / \beta$, if $\beta \neq 0$. This follows from Theorem 31.3 and is also included in the following theorem.

31.12 Theorem Let $E$ be an extension field of $F$. Then

$$
\bar{F}_{E}=\{\alpha \in E \mid \alpha \text { is algebraic over } F\}
$$

is a subfield of $E$, the algebraic closure of $F$ in $E$.

Proof Let $\alpha, \beta \in \bar{F}_{E}$. Then Theorem 31.11 shows that $F(\alpha, \beta)$ is a finite extension of $F$, and by Theorem 31.3 every element of $F(\alpha, \beta)$ is algebraic over $F$, that is, $F(\alpha, \beta) \subseteq \bar{F}_{E}$. Thus
$\bar{F}_{E}$ contains $\alpha+\beta, \alpha \beta, \alpha-\beta$, and also contains $\alpha / \beta$ for $\beta \neq 0$, so $\bar{F}_{E}$ is a subfield of E.

31.13 Corollary The set of all algebraic numbers forms a field.

Proof Proof of this corollary is immediate from Theorem 31.12, because the set of all algebraic numbers is the algebraic closure of $\mathbb{Q}$ in $\mathbb{C}$.

It is well known that the complex numbers have the property that every nonconstant polynomial in $\mathbb{C}[x]$ has a zero in $\mathbb{C}$. This is known as the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra. An analytic proof of this theorem is given in Theorem 31.18. We now give a definition generalizing this important concept to other fields.

31.14 Definition A field $F$ is algebraically closed if every nonconstant polynomial in $F[x]$ has a zero in $F$.

Note that a field $F$ can be the algebraic closure of $F$ in an extension field $E$ without $F$ being algebraically closed. For example, $\mathbb{Q}$ is the algebraic closure of $\mathbb{Q}$ in $\mathbb{Q}(x)$, but $\mathbb{Q}$ is not algebraically closed because $x^{2}+1$ has no zero in $\mathbb{Q}$.

The next theorem shows that the concept of a field being algebraically closed can also be defined in terms of factorization of polynomials over the field.

31.15 Theorem A field $F$ is algebraically closed if and only if every nonconstant polynomial in $F[x]$ factors in $F[x]$ into linear factors.

Proof Let $F$ be algebraically closed, and let $f(x)$ be a nonconstant polynomial in $F[x]$ Then $f(x)$ has a zero $a \in F$. By Corollary 23.3, $x-a$ is a factor of $f(x)$, so $f(x)=$ $(x-a) g(x)$. Then if $g(x)$ is nonconstant, it has a zero $b \in F$, and we have $f(x)=$ $(x-a)(x-b) h(x)$. Continuing, we get a factorization of $f(x)$ in $F[x]$ into linear factors.

Conversely, suppose that every nonconstant polynomial of $F[x]$ has a factorization into linear factors. If $a x-b$ is a linear factor of $f(x)$, then $b / a$ is a zero of $f(x)$. Thus $F$ is algebraically closed.

31.16 Corollary An algebraically closed field $F$ has no proper algebraic extensions, that is, no algebraic extensions $E$ with $F<E$.

Proof Let $E$ be an algebraic extension of $F$, so $F \leq E$. Then if $\alpha \in E$, we have $\operatorname{irr}(\alpha, F)=$ $x-\alpha$, by Theorem 31.15, since $F$ is algebraically closed. Thus $\alpha \in F$, and we must have $F=E$.

In a moment we shall show that just as there exists an algebraically closed extension $\mathbb{C}$ of the real numbers $\mathbb{R}$, for any field $F$ there exists similarly an algebraic extension $\bar{F}$ of $F$, with the property that $\bar{F}$ is algebraically closed. Naively, to find $\bar{F}$ we proceed as follows. If a polynomial $f(x)$ in $F[x]$ has a no zero in $F$, then adjoin a zero $\alpha$ of such an $f(x)$ to $F$, thus obtaining the field $F(\alpha)$. Theorem 29.3, Kronecker's theorem, is strongly used here, of course. If $F(\alpha)$ is still not algebraically closed, then continue the process further. The trouble is that, contrary to the situation for the algebraic closure $\mathbb{C}$ of $\mathbb{R}$, we may have to do this a (possibly large) infinite number of times. It can be shown (see Exercises 33 and 36) that $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$ is isomorphic to the field of all algebraic numbers, and that
we cannot obtain $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$ from $\mathbb{Q}$ by adjoining a finite number of algebraic numbers. We shall have to first discuss some set-theoretic machinery, Zorn's lemma, in order to be able to handle such a situation. This machinery is a bit complex, so we are putting the proof under a separate heading. The existence theorem for $\bar{F}$ is very important, and we state it here so that we will know this fact, even if we do not study the proof.

31.17 Theorem Every field $F$ has an algebraic closure, that is, an algebraic extension $\bar{F}$ that is algebraically closed.

It is well known that $\mathbb{C}$ is an algebraically closed field. We recall an analytic proof for the student who has had a course in functions of a complex variable. There are algebraic proofs, but they are much longer.

31.18 Theorem (Fundamental Theorem of Algebra) The field $\mathbb{C}$ of complex numbers is an algebraically closed field.

Proof Let the polynomial $f(z) \in \mathbb{C}[z]$ have no zero in $\mathbb{C}$. Then $1 / f(z)$ gives an entire function; that is, $1 / f$ is analytic everywhere. Also if $f \notin \mathbb{C}, \lim _{|z| \rightarrow \infty}|f(z)|=\infty$, so $\lim _{|z| \rightarrow \infty}$ $|1 / f(z)|=0$. Thus $1 / f$ must be bounded in the plane. Hence by Liouville's theorem of complex function theory, $1 / f$ is constant, and thus $f$ is constant. Therefore, a nonconstant polynomial in $\mathbb{C}[z]$ must have a zero in $\mathbb{C}$, so $\mathbb{C}$ is algebraically closed.

## Proof of the Existence of an Algebraic Closure

We shall prove that every field has an algebraic extension that is algebraically closed. Mathematics students should have the opportunity to see some proof involving the Axiom of Choice by the time they finish college. This is a natural place for such a proof. We shall use an equivalent form, Zorn's lemma, of the Axiom of Choice. To state Zorn's lemma, we have to give a set-theoretic definition.

31.19 Definition A partial ordering of a set $S$ is given by a relation $\leq$ defined for certain ordered pairs of elements of $\mathrm{S}$ such that the following conditions are satisfied:

1. $a \leq a$ for all $a \in S$ (reflexive law).
2. If $a \leq b$ and $b \leq a$, then $a=b$ (antisymmetric law).
3. If $a \leq b$ and $b \leq c$, then $a \leq c$ (transitive law).

In a partially ordered set, not every two elements need be comparable; that is, for $a, b \in S$, we need not have either $a \leq b$ or $b \leq a$. As usual, $a<b$ denotes $a \leq b$ but $a \neq b$.

A subset $T$ of a partially ordered set $S$ is a chain if every two elements $a$ and $b$ in $T$ are comparable, that is, either $a \leq b$ or $b \leq a$ (or both). An element $u \in S$ is an upper bound for a subset $A$ of partially ordered set $S$ if $a \leq u$ for all $a \in A$. Finally, an element $m$ of a partially ordered set $S$ is maximal if there is no $s \in S$ such that $m<s$.

31.20 Example The collection of all subsets of a set forms a partially ordered set under the relation $\leq$ given by $\subseteq$. For example, if the whole set is $\mathbb{R}$, we have $\mathbb{Z} \subseteq \mathbb{Q}$. Note, however, that for $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Q}^{+}$, neither $\mathbb{Z} \subseteq \mathbb{Q}^{+}$nor $\mathbb{Q}^{+} \subseteq \mathbb{Z}$.

31.21 Zorn's Lemma If $S$ is a partially ordered set such that every chain in $S$ has an upper bound in $S$, then $S$ has at least one maximal element.

There is no question of proving Zorn's lemma. The lemma is equivalent to the Axiom of Choice. Thus we are really taking Zorn's lemma here as an axiom for our set theory. Refer to the literature for a statement of the Axiom of Choice and a proof of its equivalence to Zorn's lemma. (See Edgerton [47].)

Zorn's lemma is often useful when we want to show the existence of a largest or maximal structure of some kind. If a field $F$ has an algebraic extension $\bar{F}$ that is algebraically closed, then $\bar{F}$ will certainly be a maximal algebraic extension of $F$, for since $\bar{F}$ is algebraically closed, it can have no proper algebraic extensions.

The idea of our proof of Theorem 31.17 is very simple. Given a field $F$, we shall first describe a class of algebraic extensions of $F$ that is so large that it must contain (up to isomorphism) any conceivable algebraic extension of $F$. We then define a partial ordering, the ordinary subfield ordering, on this class, and show that the hypotheses of Zorn's lemma are satisfied. By Zorn's lemma, there will exist a maximal algebraic extension $\bar{F}$ of $F$ in this class. We shall then argue that, as a maximal element, this extension $\bar{F}$ can have no proper algebraic extensions, so it must be algebraically closed.

Our proof differs a bit from the one found in many texts. We like it because it uses no algebra other than that derived from Theorems 29.3 and 31.4. Thus it throws into sharp relief the tremendous strength of both Kronecker's theorem and Zorn's lemma. The proof looks long, but only because we are writing out every little step. To the professional mathematician, the construction of the proof from the information in the preceding paragraph is a routine matter. This proof was suggested to the author during his graduate student days by a fellow graduate student, Norman Shapiro, who also had a strong preference for it.

## Historical Note

$\mathrm{T}$ he Axiom of Choice, although used implicitly in the 1870 s and 1880 s, was first stated explicitly by Ernst Zermelo in 1904 in connection with his proof of the well-ordering theorem, the result that for any set $A$, there exists an order-relation < such that every nonempty subset $B$ of $A$ contains a least element with respect to $<$. Zermelo's Axiom of Choice asserted that, given any set $M$ and the set $S$ of all subsets of $M$, there always exists a "choice" function, a function $f: S \rightarrow M$ such that $f\left(M^{\prime}\right) \in M^{\prime}$ for every $M^{\prime}$ in $S$. Zermelo noted, in fact, that "this logical principal cannot ... be reduced to a still simpler one, but it is applied without hesitation everywhere in mathematical deduction." A few years later he included this axiom in his collection of axioms for set theory, a collection which was slightly modified in 1930 into what is now called Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, the axiom system generally used today as a basis of that theory.

Zorn's lemma was introduced by Max Zorn (1906-1993) in 1935. Although he realized that it was equivalent to the well-ordering theorem (itself equivalent to the Axiom of Choice), he claimed that his lemma was more natural to use in algebra because the well-ordering theorem was somehow a "transcendental" principal. Other mathematicians soon agreed with his reasoning. The lemma appeared in 1939 in the first volume of Nicolas Bourbaki's Eléments de Mathématique: Les Structures Fondamentales de I'Analyse. It was used consistently in that work and quickly became an essential part of the mathematician's toolbox.

We are now ready to carry out our proof of Theorem 31.17, which we restate here.

31.22 Restated Theorem 31.17 Every field $F$ has an algebraic closure $\bar{F}$.

Proof It can be shown in set theory that given any set, there exists a set with strictly more elements. Suppose we form a set

$$
A=\left\{\omega_{f, i} \mid f \in F[x] ; i=0, \cdots,(\text { degree } f)\right\}
$$

that has an element for every possible zero of any $f(x) \in F[x]$. Let $\Omega$ be a set with strictly more elements than $A$. Replacing $\Omega$ by $\Omega \cup F$ if necessary, we can assume $F \subset \Omega$. Consider all possible fields that are algebraic extension of $F$ and that, as sets, consist of elements of $\Omega$. One such algebraic extension is $F$ itself. If $E$ is any extension field of $F$, and if $\gamma \in E$ is a zero $f(x) \in F[x]$ for $\gamma \notin F$ and $\operatorname{deg}(\gamma, F)=n$, then renaming $\gamma$ by $\omega$ for $\omega \in \Omega$ and $\omega \notin F$, and renaming elements $a_{0}+a_{1} \gamma+\cdots+a_{n-1} \gamma^{n-1}$ of $F(\gamma)$ by distinct elements of $\Omega$ as the $a_{i}$ range over $F$, we can consider our renamed $F(\gamma)$ to be an algebraic extension field $F(\omega)$ of $F$, with $F(\omega) \subset \Omega$ and $f(\omega)=0$. The set $\Omega$ has enough elements to form $F(\omega)$, since $\Omega$ has more than enough elements to provide $n$ different zeros for each element of each degree $n$ in any subset of $F[x]$.

All algebraic extension fields $E_{j}$ of $F$, with $E_{j} \subseteq \Omega$, form a set

$$
S=\left\{E_{j} \mid j \in J\right\}
$$

that is partially ordered under our usual subfield inclusion $\leq$. One element of $S$ is $F$ itself. The preceding paragraphs shows that if $F$ is far away from being algebraically closed, there will be many fields $E_{j}$ in $S$.

Let $T=\left\{E_{j_{k}}\right\}$ be a chain in $S$, and let $W=\cup_{k} E_{j_{k}}$. We now make $W$ into a field. Let $\alpha, \beta \in W$. Then there exist $E_{j_{1}}, E_{j_{2}} \in S$, with $\alpha \in E_{j_{1}}$ and $\beta \in E_{j_{2}}$. Since $T$ is a chain, one of the fields $E_{j_{1}}$ and $E_{j_{2}}$ is a subfield of the other, say $E_{j_{1}} \leq E_{j_{2}}$. Then $\alpha, \beta \in E_{j_{2}}$, and we use the field operations of $E_{j_{2}}$ to define the sum of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ in $W$ as $(\alpha+\beta) \in E_{j_{2}}$ and, likewise, the product as $(\alpha \beta) \in E_{j_{2}}$. These operations are well defined in $W$; they are independent of our choice of $E_{j_{2}}$, since if $\alpha, \beta \in E_{j_{3}}$ also, for $E_{j_{3}}$ in $T$, then one of the fields $E_{j_{2}}$ and $E_{j_{3}}$ is a subfield of the other, since $T$ is a chain. Thus we have operations of addition and multiplication defined on $W$.

All the field axioms for $W$ under these operations now follow from the fact that these operations were defined in terms of addition and multiplication in fields. Thus, for example, $1 \in F$ serves as multiplicative identity in $W$, since for $\alpha \in W$, if $1, \alpha \in E_{j_{1}}$, then we have $1 \alpha=\alpha$ in $E_{j_{i}}$, so $1 \alpha=\alpha$ in $W$, by definition of multiplication in $W$. As further illustration, to check the distributive laws, let $\alpha, \beta, \gamma \in W$. Since $T$ is a chain, we can find one field in $T$ containing all three elements $\alpha, \beta$, and $\gamma$, and in this field the distributive laws for $\alpha, \beta$, and $\gamma$ hold. Thus they hold in $W$. Therefore, we can view $W$ as a field, and by construction, $E_{j_{k}} \leq W$ for every $E_{j_{k}} \in T$.

If we can show that $W$ is algebraic over $F$, then $W \in S$ will be an upper bound for $T$. But if $\alpha \in W$, then $\alpha \in E_{j_{1}}$ for some $E_{j_{1}}$ in $T$, so $\alpha$ is algebraic over $F$. Hence $W$ is an algebraic extension of $F$ and is an upper bound for $T$.

The hypotheses of Zorn's lemma are thus fulfilled, so there is a maximal element $\bar{F}$ of $S$. We claim that $\bar{F}$ is algebraically closed. Let $f(x) \in \bar{F}[x]$, where $f(x) \notin \bar{F}$. Suppose that $f(x)$ has no zero in $\bar{F}$. Since $\Omega$ has many more elements than $\bar{F}$ has, we
can take $\omega \in \Omega$, where $\omega \notin \bar{F}$, and form a field $\bar{F}(\omega) \subseteq \Omega$, with $\omega$ a zero of $f(x)$, as we saw in the first paragraph of this proof. Let $\beta$ be in $\bar{F}(\omega)$. Then by Theorem $30.23, \beta$ is a zero of a polynomial

$$
g(x)=\alpha_{0}+\alpha_{1} x+\cdots+\alpha_{n} x^{n}
$$

in $\bar{F}[x]$, with $\alpha_{i} \in \bar{F}$, and hence $\alpha_{i}$ algebraic over $F$. Then by Theorem 31.11 the field $F\left(\alpha_{0}, \cdots, \alpha_{n}\right)$ is a finite extension of $F$, and since $\beta$ is algebraic over $F\left(\alpha_{0}, \cdots, \alpha_{n}\right)$, we also see that $F\left(\alpha_{0}, \cdots, \alpha_{n}, \beta\right)$ is a finite extension over $F\left(\alpha_{0}, \cdots, \alpha_{n}\right)$. Theorem 31.4 then shows that $F\left(\alpha_{0}, \cdots, \alpha_{n}, \beta\right)$ is a finite extension of $F$, so by Theorem 31.3, $\beta$ is algebraic over $F$. Hence $\bar{F}(\omega) \in S$ and $\bar{F}<\bar{F}(\omega)$, which contradicts the choice of $\bar{F}$ as maximal in $S$. Thus $f(x)$ must have had a zero in $\bar{F}$, so $\bar{F}$ is algebraically closed.

The mechanics of the preceding proof are routine to the professional mathematician. Since it may be the first proof that we have ever seen using Zorn's lemma, we wrote the proof out in detail.

## SECTION 32 †GEOMETRic CONSTRUCTIONS

In this section we digress briefly to give an application demonstrating the power of Theorem 31.4. For a more detailed study of geometric constructions, you are referred to Courant and Robbins [44, Chapter III].

We are interested in what types of figures can be constructed with a compass and a straightedge in the sense of classical Euclidean plane geometry. We shall discuss the impossibility of trisecting certain angles and other classical questions.

## Constructible Numbers

Let us imagine that we are given only a single line segment that we shall define to be one unit in length. A real number $\alpha$ is constructible if we can construct a line segment of length $|\alpha|$ in a finite number of steps from this given segment of unit length by using a straightedge and a compass.

The rules of the game are pretty strict. We suppose that we are given just two points at the moment, the endpoints of our unit line segment, let us suppose that they correspond to the points $(0,0)$ and $(1,0)$ in the Euclidean plane. We are allowed to draw a line only with our straightedge through two points that we have already located. Thus we can start by using the straightedge and drawing the line through $(0,0)$ and $(1,0)$. We are allowed to open our compass only to a distance between points we have already found. Let us open our compass to the distance between $(0,0)$ and $(1,0)$. We can then place the point of the compass at $(1,0)$ and draw a circle of radius 1 , which passes through the point $(2,0)$. Thus we now have located a third point, $(2,0)$. Continuing in this way, we can locate points $(3,0),(4,0),(-1,0),(-2,0)$, and so on. Now open the compass the distance from $(0,0)$ to $(0,2)$, put the point at $(1,0)$, and draw a circle of radius 2 . Do the same with the point at $(-1,0)$. We have now found two new points, where these circles intersect, and we can put our straightedge on them to draw what we think of as the $y$-axis. Then opening our compass to the distance from $(0,0)$ to $(1,0)$, we draw a circle with center at $(0,0)$ and locate the point $(0,1)$ where the circle intersects the $y$-axis. Continuing in this fashion, we can locate all points $(x, y)$ with integer coordinates in any rectangle containing the point $(0,0)$. Without going into more detail, it can be shown that it is possible, among other things, to erect a perpendicular to a given line at a known point[^18]on the line, and find a line passing through a known point and parallel to a given line. Our first result is the following theorem.

32.1 Theorem If $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are constructible real numbers, then so are $\alpha+\beta, \alpha-\beta, \alpha \beta$, and $\alpha / \beta$, if $\beta \neq 0$.

Proof We are given that $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are constructible, so there are line segments of lengths $|\alpha|$ and $|\beta|$ available to us. For $\alpha, \beta>0$, extend a line segment of length $\alpha$ with the straightedge. Start at one end of the original segment of length $\alpha$, and lay off on the extension the length $\beta$ with the compass. This constructs a line segment of length $\alpha+\beta ; \alpha-\beta$ is similiarly constructible (see Fig. 32.2). If $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are not both positive, an obvious breakdown into cases according to their signs shows that $\alpha+\beta$ and $\alpha-\beta$ are still constructible.

The construction of $\alpha \beta$ is indicated in Fig. 32.3. We shall let $\overline{O A}$ be the line segment from the point $O$ to the point $A$, and shall let $|\overline{O A}|$ be the length of this line segment. If $\overline{O A}$ is of length $|\alpha|$, construct a line $l$ through $O$ not containing $\overline{O A}$. (Perhaps, if $O$ is at $(0,0)$ and $A$ is at $(a, 0)$, you use the line through $(0,0)$ and $(4,2)$.) Then find the points $P$ and $B$ on $l$ such that $\overline{O P}$ is of length 1 and $\overline{O B}$ is of length $|\beta|$. Draw $\overline{P A}$ and construct $l^{\prime}$ through $B$, parallel to $\overline{P A}$ and intersecting $\overline{O A}$ extended at $Q$. By similar triangles, we have

$$
\frac{1}{|\alpha|}=\frac{|\beta|}{|\overline{O Q}|}
$$

so $\overline{O Q}$ is of length $|\alpha \beta|$.

Finally, Fig. 32.4 shows that $\alpha / \beta$ is constructible if $\beta \neq 0$. Let $\overline{O A}$ be of length $|\alpha|$, and construct $l$ through $O$ not containing $O A$. Then find $B$ and $P$ on $l$ such that $\overline{O B}$ is of length $|\beta|$ and $\overline{O P}$ is of length 1 . Draw $B A$ and construct $l^{\prime}$ through $P$, parallel to $\overline{B A}$, and intersecting $\overline{O A}$ at $Q$. Again by similar triangles, we have

$$
\frac{|\overline{O Q}|}{1}=\frac{|\alpha|}{|\beta|}
$$

so $\overline{O Q}$ is of length $|\alpha / \beta|$.

32.5 Corollary

The set of all constructible real numbers forms a subfield $F$ of the field of real numbers.

Proof Proof of this corollary is immediate from Theorem 32.1.

Thus the field $F$ of all constructible real numbers contains $\mathbb{Q}$, the field of rational numbers, since $\mathbb{Q}$ is the smallest subfield of $\mathbb{R}$.

From now on, we proceed analytically. We can construct any rational number. Regarding our given segment

$$
0 \_\_1
$$

of length 1 as the basic unit on an $x$-axis, we can locate any point $\left(q_{1}, q_{2}\right)$ in the plane with both coordinates rational. Any further point in the plane that we can locate by using a compass and a straightedge can be found in one of the following three ways:

1. as an intersection of two lines, each of which passes through two known points having rational coordinates,
2. as an intersection of a line that passes through two points having rational coordinates and a circle whose center has rational coordinates and whose radius is rational.
3. as an intersection of two circles whose centers have rational coordinates and whose radii are rational.

Equations of lines and circles of the type discussed in 1,2, and 3 are of the form

$$
a x+b y+c=0
$$

and

$$
x^{2}+y^{2}+d x+e y+f=0
$$

where $a, b, c, d, e$, and $f$ are all in $\mathbb{Q}$. Since in Case 3 the intersection of two circles with equations

$$
x^{2}+y^{2}+d_{1} x+e_{1} y+f_{1}=0
$$

and

$$
x^{2}+y^{2}+d_{2} x+e_{2} y+f_{2}=0
$$

is the same as the intersection of the first circle having equation

$$
x^{2}+y^{2}+d_{1} x+e_{1} y+f_{1}=0,
$$

and the line (the common chord) having equation

$$
\left(d_{1}-d_{2}\right) x+\left(e_{1}-e_{2}\right) y+f_{1}-f_{2}=0,
$$

we see that Case 3 can be reduced to Case 2. For Case 1, a simultaneous solution of two linear equations with rational coefficients can only lead to rational values of $x$ and $y$, giving us no new points. However, finding a simultaneous solution of a linear equation with rational coefficients and a quadratic equation with rational coefficients, as in Case 2, leads, upon substitution, to a quadratic equation. Such an equation, when solved by the quadratic formula, may have solutions involving square roots of numbers that are not squares in $\mathbb{Q}$.

In the preceding argument, nothing was really used involving $\mathbb{Q}$ except field axioms. If $H$ is the smallest field containing those real numbers constructed so far, the argument shows that the "next new number" constructed lies in a field $H(\sqrt{\alpha})$ for some $\alpha \in H$, where $\alpha>0$. We have proved half of our next theorem.

32.6 Theorem The field $F$ of constructible real numbers consists precisely of all real numbers that we can obtain from $\mathbb{Q}$ by taking square roots of positive numbers a finite number of times and applying a finite number of field operations.

Proof We have shown that $F$ can contain no numbers except those we obtain from $\mathbb{Q}$ by taking a finite number of square roots of positive numbers and applying a finite number of field operations. However, if $\alpha>0$ is constructible, then Fig. 32.7 shows that $\sqrt{\alpha}$ is constructible. Let $\overline{O A}$ have length $\alpha$, and find $P$ on $\overline{O A}$ extended so that $\overline{O P}$ has length 1. Find the midpoint of $\overline{P A}$ and draw a semicircle with $\overline{P A}$ as diameter. Erect a perpendicular to $\overline{P A}$ at $O$, intersecting the semicircle at $Q$. Then the triangles $O P Q$ and $O Q A$ are similar, so

$$
\frac{|\overline{O Q}|}{|\overline{O A}|}=\frac{|\overline{O P}|}{|\overline{O Q}|}
$$

and $|\overline{O Q}|^{2}=1 \alpha=\alpha$. Thus $\overline{O Q}$ is of length $\sqrt{\alpha}$. Therefore square roots of constructible numbers are constructible.

Theorem 32.1 showed that field operations are possible by construction.

32.8 Corollary If $\gamma$ is constructible and $\gamma \notin \mathbb{Q}$, then there is a finite sequence of real numbers $\alpha_{1}, \cdots, \alpha_{n}=\gamma$ such that $\mathbb{Q}\left(\alpha_{1}, \cdots, \alpha_{i}\right)$ is an extension of $\mathbb{Q}\left(\alpha_{1}, \cdots, \alpha_{i-1}\right)$ of degree 2 . In particular, $[\mathbb{Q}(\gamma): \mathbb{Q}]=2^{r}$ for some integer $r \geq 0$.

Proof The existence of the $\alpha_{i}$ is immediate from Theorem 32.6. Then

$$
\begin{aligned}
2^{n} & =\left[\mathbb{Q}\left(\alpha_{1}, \cdots, \alpha_{n}\right): \mathbb{Q}\right] \\
& =\left[\mathbb{Q}\left(\alpha_{1}, \cdots, \alpha_{n}\right): \mathbb{Q}(\gamma)\right][\mathbb{Q}(\gamma): \mathbb{Q}],
\end{aligned}
$$

by Theorem 31.4, which completes the proof.

## The Impossibility of Certain Constructions

We can now show the impossibility of certain geometric constructions.

32.9 Theorem Doubling the cube is impossible, that is, given a side of a cube, it is not always possible to construct with a straightedge and a compass the side of a cube that has double the volume of the original cube.

Proof Let the given cube have a side of length 1, and hence a volume of 1 . The cube being sought would have to have a volume of 2 , and hence a side of length $\sqrt[3]{2}$. But $\sqrt[3]{2}$ is a zero of irreducible $x^{3}-2$ over $\mathbb{Q}$, so

$$
[\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2}): \mathbb{Q}]=3
$$

Corollary 32.8 shows that to double this cube of volume 1 , we would need to have $3=2^{r}$ for some integer $r$, but no such $r$ exists.

32.10 Theorem Squaring the circle is impossible; that is, given a circle, it is not always possible to construct with a straightedge and a compass a square having area equal to the area of the given circle.

Proof Let the given circle have a radius of 1 , and hence an area of $\pi$. We would need to construct a square of side $\sqrt{\pi}$. But $\pi$ is transcendental over $\mathbb{Q}$, so $\sqrt{\pi}$ is transcendental over $\mathbb{Q}$ also.

32.11 Theorem Trisecting the angle is impossible; that is, there exists an angle that cannot be trisected with a straightedge and a compass.

Proof Figure 32.12 indicates that the angle $\theta$ can be constructed if and only if a segment of length $|\cos \theta|$ can be constructed. Now $60^{\circ}$ is a constructible angle, and we shall show that it cannot be trisected. Note that

$$
\begin{aligned}
\cos 3 \theta & =\cos (2 \theta+\theta) \\
& =\cos 2 \theta \cos \theta-\sin 2 \theta \sin \theta \\
& =\left(2 \cos ^{2} \theta-1\right) \cos \theta-2 \sin \theta \cos \theta \sin \theta \\
& =\left(2 \cos ^{2} \theta-1\right) \cos \theta-2 \cos \theta\left(1-\cos ^{2} \theta\right) \\
& =4 \cos ^{3} \theta-3 \cos \theta
\end{aligned}
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_01_27_9289ad7bed1dd2e5e553g-303.jpg?height=369&width=563&top_left_y=458&top_left_x=911)

[We realize that many students today have not seen the trigonometric identities we just used. Exercise 1 repeats Exercise 40 of Section 1 and asks you to prove the identity $\cos 3 \theta=4 \cos ^{3} \theta-3 \cos \theta$ from Euler's formula.]

Let $\theta=20^{\circ}$, so that $\cos 3 \theta=\frac{1}{2}$, and let $\alpha=\cos 20^{\circ}$. From the identity $4 \cos ^{3} \theta-$ $3 \cos \theta=\cos 3 \theta$, we see that

$$
4 \alpha^{3}-3 \alpha=\frac{1}{2}
$$

Thus $\alpha$ is a zero of $8 x^{3}-6 x-1$. This polynomial is irreducible in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$, since, by Theorem 23.11, it is enough to show that it does not factor in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$. But a factorization in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$ would entail a linear factor of the form $(8 x \pm 1),(4 x \pm 1),(2 x \pm 1)$, or $(x \pm 1)$. We can quickly check that none of the numbers $\pm \frac{1}{8}, \pm \frac{1}{4}, \pm \frac{1}{2}$, and $\pm 1$ is a zero of $8 x^{3}-6 x-1$. Thus

$$
[\mathbb{Q}(\alpha): \mathbb{Q}]=3,
$$

so by Corollary 32.8, $\alpha$ is not constructible. Hence $60^{\circ}$ cannot be trisected.

## Historical Note

$\mathrm{G}$ reek mathematicians as far back as the fourth century B.C. had tried without success to find geometric constructions using straightedge and compass to trisect the angle, double the cube, and square the circle. Although they were never able to prove that such constructions were impossible, they did manage to construct the solutions to these problems using other tools, including the conic sections.

It was Carl Gauss in the early nineteenth century who made a detailed study of constructibility in connection with his solution of cyclotomic equations, the equations of the form $x^{p}-1=0$ with $p$ prime whose roots form the vertices of a regular $p$-gon. He showed that although all such equations are solvable using radicals, if $p-1$ is not a power of 2, then the solutions must involve roots higher than the second. In fact, Gauss asserted that anyone who attempted to find a geometric construction for a $p$-gon where $p-1$ is not a power of 2 would "spend his time uselessly." Interestingly, Gauss did not prove the assertion that such constructions were impossible. That was accomplished in 1837 by Pierre Wantzel (1814-1848), who in fact proved Corollary 32.8 and also demonstrated Theorems 32.9 and 32.11. The proof of Theorem 32.10, on the other hand, requires a proof that $\pi$ is transcendental, a result finally achieved in 1882 by Ferdinand Lindemann (1852-1939).

Note that the regular $n$-gon is constructible for $n \geq 3$ if and only if the angle $2 \pi / n$ is constructible, which is the case if and only if a line segment of length $\cos (2 \pi / n)$ is constructible.

## SECTION 33 Finite FieLdS

The purpose of this section is to determine the structure of all finite fields. We shall show that for every prime $p$ and positive integer $n$, there is exactly one finite field (up to isomorphism) of order $p^{n}$. This field $\mathrm{GF}\left(p^{n}\right)$ is usually referred to as the Galois field of order $p^{n}$. We shall be using quite a bit of our material on cyclic groups. The proofs are simple and elegant.

## The Structure of a Finite Field

We now show that all finite fields must have prime-power order.

33.1 Theorem Let $E$ be a finite extension of degree $n$ over a finite field $F$. If $F$ has $q$ elements, then $E$ has $q^{n}$ elements.

Proof Let $\left\{\alpha_{1}, \cdots, \alpha_{n}\right\}$ be a basis for $E$ as a vector space over $F$. By Exercise 21 of Section 30, every $\beta \in E$ can be uniquely written in the form

$$
\beta=b_{1} \alpha_{1}+\cdots+b_{n} \alpha_{n}
$$

for $b_{i} \in F$. Since each $b_{i}$ may be any of the $q$ elements of $F$, the total number of such distinct linear combinations of the $\alpha_{i}$ is $q^{n}$.

33.2 Corollary If $E$ is a finite field of characteristic $p$, then $E$ contains exactly $p^{n}$ elements for some positive integer $n$.

Proof Every finite field $E$ is a finite extension of a prime field isomorphic to the field $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$, where $p$ is the characteristic of $E$. The corollary follows at once from Theorem 33.1.

We now turn to the study of the multiplicative structure of a finite field. The following theorem will show us how any finite field can be formed from the prime subfield.

33.3 Theorem Let $E$ be a field of $p^{n}$ elements contained in an algebraic closure $\overline{\mathbb{Z}}_{p}$ of $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$. The elements of $E$ are precisely the zeros in $\overline{\mathbb{Z}}_{p}$ of the polynomial $x^{p^{n}}-x$ in $\mathbb{Z}_{p}[x]$.

Proof The set $E^{*}$ of nonzero elements of $E$ forms a multiplicative group of order $p^{n}-1$ under the field multiplication. For $\alpha \in E^{*}$, the order of $\alpha$ in this group divides the order $p^{n}-1$ of the group. Thus for $\alpha \in E^{*}$, we have $\alpha^{p^{n}-1}=1$, so $\alpha^{p^{n}}=\alpha$. Therefore, every element in $E$ is a zero of $x^{p^{n}}-x$. Since $x^{p^{n}}-x$ can have at most $p^{n}$ zeros, we see that $E$ contains precisely the zeros of $x^{p^{n}}-x$ in $\overline{\mathbb{Z}}_{p}$.

33.4 Definition An element $\alpha$ of a field is an $\boldsymbol{n}$ th root of unity if $\alpha^{n}=1$. It is a primitive $\boldsymbol{n}$ th root of unity if $\alpha^{n}=1$ and $\alpha^{m} \neq 1$ for $0<m<n$.

Thus the nonzero elements of a finite field of $p^{n}$ elements are all $\left(p^{n}-1\right)$ th roots of unity.

Recall that in Corollary 23.6, we showed that the multiplicative group of nonzero elements of a finite field is cyclic. This is a very important fact about finite fields; it has actually been applied to algebraic coding. For the sake of completeness in this section, we now state it here as a theorem, give a corollary, and illustrate with an example.

33.5 Theorem The multiplicative group $\left\langle F^{*}, \cdot\right\rangle$ of nonzero elements of a finite field $F$ is cyclic.

Proof See Corollary 23.6.

33.6 Corollary A finite extension $E$ of a finite field $F$ is a simple extension of $F$.

Proof Let $\alpha$ be a generator for the cyclic group $E^{*}$ of nonzero elements of $E$. Then $E=F(\alpha)$.

33.7 Example Consider the finite field $\mathbb{Z}_{11}$. By Theorem $33.5\left\langle\mathbb{Z}_{11}{ }^{*}, \cdot\right\rangle$ is cyclic. Let us try to find a generator of $\mathbb{Z}_{11}{ }^{*}$ by brute force and ignorance. We start by trying 2 . Since $\left|\mathbb{Z}_{11}{ }^{*}\right|=10,2$ must be an element of $\mathbb{Z}_{11}{ }^{*}$ of order dividing 10 , that is, either 2,5 , or 10 . Now

$$
2^{2}=4, \quad 2^{4}=4^{2}=5, \quad \text { and } \quad 2^{5}=(2)(5)=10=-1 \text {. }
$$

Thus neither $2^{2}$ nor $2^{5}$ is 1 , but, of course, $2^{10}=1$, so 2 is a generator of $\mathbb{Z}_{11}{ }^{*}$, that is, 2 is a primitive 10 th root of unity in $\mathbb{Z}_{11}$. We were lucky.

By the theory of cyclic groups, all the generators of $Z_{11}{ }^{*}$, that is, all the primitive 10 th roots of unity in $\mathbb{Z}_{11}$, are of the form $2^{n}$, where $n$ is relatively prime to 10 . These elements are

$$
2^{1}=2, \quad 2^{3}=8, \quad 2^{7}=7, \quad 2^{9}=6
$$

## Historical Note

A lthough Carl F. Gauss had shown that the set of residues modulo a prime $p$ satisfied the field properties, it was Evariste Galois (1811-1832) who first dealt with what he called "incommensurable solutions" to the congruence $F(x) \equiv 0(\bmod p)$, where $F(x)$ is an $n$th degree irreducible polynomial modulo $p$. He noted in a paper written in 1830 that one should consider the roots of this congruence as "a variety of imaginary symbols" that one can use in calculations just as one uses $\sqrt{-1}$. Galois then showed that if $\alpha$ is any solution of $F(x) \equiv 0$ $(\bmod p)$, the expression $a_{0}+a_{1} \alpha+a_{2} \alpha^{2}+\cdots+$ $a_{n-1} \alpha^{n-1}$ takes on precisely $p^{n}$ different values. Finally, he proved results equivalent to Theorems 33.3 and 33.5 of the text.

Galois' life was brief and tragic. He showed brilliance in mathematics early on, publishing several papers before he was 20 and essentially established the basic ideas of Galois theory. He was, however, active in French revolutionary politics following the July revolution of 1830 . In May 1831, he was arrested for threatening the life of King Louis-Philippe. Though he was acquitted, he was rearrested for participating, heavily armed, in a republican demonstration on Bastille Day of that year. Two months after his release from prison the following March, he was killed in a duel, "the victim of an infamous coquette and her two dupes"; the previous night he had written a letter to a friend clarifying some of his work in the theory of equations and requesting that it be studied by other mathematicians. Not until 1846, however, were his major papers published; it is from that date that his work became influential.

The primitive 5 th roots of unity in $\mathbb{Z}_{11}$ are of the form $2^{m}$, where the gcd of $m$ and 10 is 2 , that is,

$$
2^{2}=4, \quad 2^{4}=5, \quad 2^{6}=9, \quad 2^{8}=3 .
$$

The primitive square root of unity in $\mathbb{Z}_{11}$ is $2^{5}=10=-1$.

## The Existence of $\operatorname{GF}\left(p^{\boldsymbol{n}}\right)$

We turn now to the question of the existence of a finite field of order $p^{r}$ for every prime power $p^{r}, r>0$. We need the following lemma.

33.8 Lemma If $F$ is a field of prime characteristic $p$ with algebraic closure $\bar{F}$, then $x^{p^{n}}-x$ has $p^{n}$ distinct zeros in $\bar{F}$.

Proof Because $\bar{F}$ is algebraically closed, $x^{p^{n}}-x$ factors over that field into a product of linear factors $x-\alpha$, so it suffices to show that none of these factors occurs more than once in the factorization.

Since we have not introduced an algebraic theory of derivatives, this elegant technique is not available to us, so we proceed by long division. Observe that 0 is a zero of $x^{p^{n}}-x$ of multiplicity 1 . Suppose $\alpha \neq 0$ is a zero of $x^{p^{n}}-x$, and hence is a zero of $f(x)=x^{p^{n}-1}-1$. Then $x-\alpha$ is a factor of $f(x)$ in $\bar{F}[x]$, and by long division, we find
that

$$
\begin{gathered}
\frac{f(x)}{(x-\alpha)}=g(x) \\
=x^{p^{n}-2}+\alpha x^{p^{n}-3}+\alpha^{2} x^{p^{n}-4}+\cdots+\alpha^{p^{n}-3} x+\alpha^{p^{n}-2} .
\end{gathered}
$$

Now $g(x)$ has $p^{n}-1$ summands, and in $g(\alpha)$, each summand is

$$
\alpha^{p^{n}-2}=\frac{\alpha^{p^{n}-1}}{\alpha}=\frac{1}{\alpha}
$$

Thus

$$
g(\alpha)=\left[\left(p^{n}-1\right) \cdot 1\right] \frac{1}{\alpha}=-\frac{1}{\alpha}
$$

since we are in a field of characteristic $p$. Therefore, $g(\alpha) \neq 0$, so $\alpha$ is a zero of $f(x)$ of multiplicity 1.

33.9 Lemma If $F$ is a field of prime characteristic $p$, then $(\alpha+\beta)^{p^{n}}=\alpha^{p^{n}}+\beta^{p^{n}}$ for all $\alpha, \beta \in F$ and all positive integers $n$.

Proof Let $\alpha, \beta \in F$. Applying the binomial theorem to $(\alpha+\beta)^{p}$, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
(\alpha+\beta)^{p}= & \alpha^{p}+(p \cdot 1) \alpha^{p-1} \beta+\left(\frac{p(p-1)}{2} \cdot 1\right) \alpha^{p-2} \beta^{2} \\
& +\cdots+(p \cdot 1) \alpha \beta^{p-1}+\beta^{p} \\
= & \alpha^{p}+0 \alpha^{p-1} \beta+0 \alpha^{p-2} \beta^{2}+\cdots+0 \alpha \beta^{p-1}+\beta^{p} \\
= & \alpha^{p}+\beta^{p}
\end{aligned}
$$

Proceeding by induction on $n$, suppose that we have $(\alpha+\beta)^{p^{n-1}}=\alpha^{p^{n-1}}+\beta^{p^{n-1}}$. Then $(\alpha+\beta)^{p^{n}}=\left[(\alpha+\beta)^{p^{n-1}}\right]^{p}=\left(\alpha^{p^{n-1}}+\beta^{p^{n-1}}\right)^{p}=\alpha^{p^{n}}+\beta^{p^{n}}$.

33.10 Theorem A finite field $\mathrm{GF}\left(p^{n}\right)$ of $p^{n}$ elements exists for every prime power $p^{n}$.

Proof Let $\overline{\mathbb{Z}}_{p}$ be an algebraic closure of $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$, and let $K$ be the subset of $\overline{\mathbb{Z}}_{p}$ consisting of all zeros of $x^{p^{n}}-x$ in $\overline{\mathbb{Z}}_{p}$. Let $\alpha, \beta \in K$. Lemma 33.9 shows that $(\alpha+\beta) \in K$, and the equation $(\alpha \beta)^{p^{n}}=\alpha^{p^{p}} \beta^{p^{n}}=\alpha \beta$ shows that $\alpha \beta \in K$. From $\alpha^{p^{n}}=\alpha$ we obtain $(-\alpha)^{p^{n}}=$ $(-1)^{p^{n}} \alpha^{p^{n}}=(-1)^{p^{n}} \alpha$. If $p$ is an odd prime, then $(-1)^{p^{n}}=-1$ and if $p=2$ then $-1=1$. Thus $(-\alpha)^{p^{n}}=-\alpha$ so $-\alpha \in K$. Now 0 and 1 are zeros of $x^{p^{n}}-x$. For $\alpha \neq 0, \alpha^{p^{n}}=\alpha$ implies that $(1 / \alpha)^{p^{n}}=1 / \alpha$. Thus $K$ is a subfield of $\overline{\mathbb{Z}}_{p}$ containing $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$. Therefore, $K$ is the desired field of $p^{n}$ elements, since Lemma 33.8 showed that $x^{p^{n}}-x$ has $p^{n}$ distinct zeros in $\overline{\mathbb{Z}}_{p}$.

33.11 Corollary If $F$ is any finite field, then for every positive integer $n$, there is an irreducible polynomial in $F[x]$ of degree $n$.

Proof Let $F$ have $q=p^{r}$ elements, where $p$ is the characteristic of $F$. By Theorem 33.10, there is a field $K \leq \bar{F}$ containing $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ (up to isomorphism) and consisting precisely of the
zeros of $x^{p^{r n}}-x$. We want to show $F \leq K$. Every element of $F$ is a zero of $x^{p^{r}}-x$, by Theorem 33.3. Now $p^{r s}=p^{r} p^{r(s-1)}$. Applying this equation repeatedly to the exponents and using the fact that for $\alpha \in F$ we have $\alpha^{p^{r}}=\alpha$, we see that for $\alpha \in F$,

$$
\alpha^{p^{r n}}=\alpha^{p^{r(n-1)}}=\alpha^{p^{r(n-2)}}=\cdots=\alpha^{p^{r}}=\alpha .
$$

Thus $F \leq K$. Then Theorem 33.1 shows that we must have $[K: F]=n$. We have seen that $K$ is simple over $F$ in Corollary 33.6 so $K=F(\beta)$ for some $\beta \in K$. Therefore, $\operatorname{irr}(\beta, F)$ must be of degree $n$.

33.12 Theorem Let $p$ be a prime and let $n \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}$. If $E$ and $E^{\prime}$ are fields of order $p^{n}$, then $E \simeq E^{\prime}$.

Proof Both $E$ and $E^{\prime}$ have $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ as prime field, up to isomorphism. By Corollary 33.6, $E$ is a simple extension of $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ of degree $n$, so there exists an irreducible polynomial $f(x)$ of degree $n$ in $\mathbb{Z}_{p}[x]$ such that $E \simeq \mathbb{Z}_{p}[x] /\langle f(x)\rangle$. Because the elements of $E$ are zeros of $x^{p^{n}}-x$, we see that $f(x)$ is a factor of $x^{p^{n}}-x$ in $\mathbb{Z}_{p}[x]$. Because $E^{\prime}$ also consists of zeros of $x^{p^{n}}-x$, we see that $E^{\prime}$ also contains zeros of irreducible $f(x)$ in $\mathbb{Z}_{p}[x]$. Thus, because $E^{\prime}$ also contains exactly $p^{n}$ elements, $E^{\prime}$ is also isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_{p}[x] /\langle f(x)\rangle$.

Finite fields have been used in algebraic coding. In an article in the American Mathematical Monthly 77 (1970): 249-258, Norman Levinson constructs a linear code that can correct up to three errors using a finite field of order 16.

## SECTION 34 ISOMORPHISM THEOREMS

There are several theorems concerning isomorphic factor groups that are known as the isomorphism theorems of group theory. The first of these is Theorem 14.11, which we restate for easy reference. The theorem is diagrammed in Fig. 34.1.

34.2 Theorem (First Isomorphism Theorem) Let $\phi: G \rightarrow G^{\prime}$ be a homomorphism with kernel $K$, and let $\gamma_{K}: G \rightarrow G / K$ be the canonical homomorphism. There is a unique isomorphism $\mu: G / K \rightarrow \phi[G]$ such that $\phi(x)=\mu\left(\gamma_{K}(x)\right)$ for each $x \in G$.

The lemma that follows will be of great aid in our proof and intuitive understanding of the other two isomorphism theorems.

34.3 Lemma Let $N$ be a normal subgroup of a group $G$ and let $\gamma: G \rightarrow G / N$ be the canonical homomorphism. Then the map $\phi$ from the set of normal subgroups of $G$ containing $N$ to the set of normal subgroups of $G / N$ given by $\phi(L)=\gamma[L]$ is one to one and onto.

Proof Theorem 15.16 shows that if $L$ is a normal subgroup of $G$ containing $N$, then $\phi(L)=$ $\gamma[L]$ is a normal subgroup of $G / N$. Because $N \leq L$, for each $x \in L$ the entire coset $x N$ in $G$ is contained in $L$. Thus by Theorem 13.15, $\gamma^{-1}[\phi(L)]=L$. Consequently, if $L$ and $M$ are normal subgroups of $G$, both containing $N$, and if $\phi(L)=\phi(M)=H$, then $L=\gamma^{-1}[H]=M$. Therefore $\phi$ is one to one.

If $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G / N$, then $\gamma^{-1}[H]$ is a normal subgroup of $G$ by Theorem 15.16. Because $N \in H$ and $\gamma^{-1}[\{N\}]=N$, we see that $N \subseteq \gamma^{-1}[H]$. Then $\phi\left(\gamma^{-1}[H]\right)=\gamma\left[\gamma^{-1}[H]\right]=H$. This shows that $\phi$ is onto the set of normal subgroups of $G / N$.

If $H$ and $N$ are subgroups of a group $G$, then we let

$$
H N=\{h n \mid h \in H, n \in N\} .
$$

We define the join $H \vee N$ of $H$ and $N$ as the intersection of all subgroups of $G$ that contain $H N$; thus $H \vee N$ is the smallest subgroup of $G$ containing $H N$. Of course $H \vee N$ is also the smallest subgroup of $G$ containing both $H$ and $N$, since any such subgroup must contain $H N$. In general, $H N$ need not be a subgroup of $G$. However, we have the following lemma.

34.4 Lemma If $N$ is a normal subgroup of $G$, and if $H$ is any subgroup of $G$, then $H \vee N=H N=$ $N H$. Furthermore, if $H$ is also normal in $G$, then $H N$ is normal in $G$.

Proof We show that $H N$ is a subgroup of $G$, from which $H \vee N=H N$ follows at once. Let $h_{1}, h_{2} \in H$ and $n_{1}, n_{2} \in N$. Since $N$ is a normal subgroup, we have $n_{1} h_{2}=h_{2} n_{3}$ for some $n_{3} \in N$. Then $\left(h_{1} n_{1}\right)\left(h_{2} n_{2}\right)=h_{1}\left(n_{1} h_{2}\right) n_{2}=h_{1}\left(h_{2} n_{3}\right) n_{2}=\left(h_{1} h_{2}\right)\left(n_{3} n_{2}\right) \in H N$, so $H N$ is closed under the induced operation in $G$. Clearly $e=e e$ is in $H N$. For $h \in H$ and $n \in N$, we have $(h n)^{-1}=n^{-1} h^{-1}=h^{-1} n_{4}$ for some $n_{4} \in N$, since $N$ is a normal subgroup. Thus $(h n)^{-1} \in H N$, so $H N \leq G$. A similar argument shows that $N H$ is a subgroup, so $N H=H \vee N=H N$.

Now suppose that $H$ is also normal in $G$, and let $h \in H, n \in N$, and $g \in G$. Then $g h n g^{-1}=\left(g h g^{-1}\right)\left(g n g^{-1}\right) \in H N$, so $H N$ is indeed normal in $G$.

We are now ready for the second isomorphism theorem.

34.5 Theorem (Second Isomorphism Theorem) Let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$ and let $N$ be a normal subgroup of $G$. Then $(H N) / N \simeq H /(H \cap N)$.

Proof Let $\gamma: G \rightarrow G / N$ be the canonical homomorphism and let $H \leq G$. Then $\gamma[H]$ is a subgroup of $G / N$ by Theorem 13.12. Now the action of $\gamma$ on just the elements of $H$ (called $\gamma$ restricted to $H$ ) provides us with a homomorphism mapping $H$ onto $\gamma[H]$, and the kernel of this restriction is clearly the set of elements of $N$ that are also in $H$, that is, the intersection $H \cap N$. Theorem 34.2 then shows that there is an isomorphism $\mu_{1}: H /(H \cap N) \rightarrow \gamma[H]$.

On the other hand, $\gamma$ restricted to $H N$ also provides a homomorphism mapping $H N$ onto $\gamma[H]$, because $\gamma(n)$ is the identity $N$ of $G / N$ for all $n \in N$. The kernel of $\gamma$ restricted to $H N$ is $N$. Theorem 34.2 then provides us with an isomorphism $\mu_{2}:(H N) / N \rightarrow \gamma[H]$.

Because $(H N) / N$ and $H /(H \cap N)$ are both isomorphic to $\gamma[H]$, they are isomorphic to each other. Indeed, $\phi:(H N) / N \rightarrow H /(H \cap N)$ where $\phi=\mu_{1}^{-1} \mu_{2}$ will be an isomorphism. More explicitly,

$$
\phi((h n) N)=\mu_{1}^{-1}\left(\mu_{2}((h n) N)\right)=\mu_{1}^{-1}(h)=h(H \cap N) .
$$

34.6 Example

Let $G=\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}, H=\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} \times\{0\}$, and $N=\{0\} \times \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}$. Then clearly $H N=$ $\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}$ and $H \cap N=\{0\} \times \mathbb{Z} \times\{0\}$. We have $(H N) / N \simeq \mathbb{Z}$ and we also have $H /(H \cap N) \simeq \mathbb{Z}$.

If $H$ and $K$ are two normal subgroups of $G$ and $K \leq H$, then $H / K$ is a normal subgroup of $G / K$. The third isomorphism theorem concerns these groups.

34.7 Theorem (Third Isomorphism Theorem) Let $H$ and $K$ be normal subgroups of a group $G$ with $K \leq H$. Then $G / H \simeq(G / K) /(H / K)$.

Proof Let $\phi: G \rightarrow(G / K) /(H / K)$ be given by $\phi(a)=(a K)(H / K)$ for $a \in G$. Clearly $\phi$ is onto $(G / K) /(H / K)$, and for $a, b \in G$,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\phi(a b) & =[(a b) K](H / K)=[(a K)(b K)](H / K) \\
& =[(a K)(H / K)][(b K)(H / K)] \\
& =\phi(a) \phi(b)
\end{aligned}
$$

so $\phi$ is a homomorphism. The kernel consists of those $x \in G$ such that $\phi(x)=H / K$. These $x$ are just the elements of $H$. Then Theorem 34.2 shows that $G / H \simeq$ $(G / K) /(H / K)$.

A nice way of viewing Theorem 34.7 is to regard the canonical map $\gamma_{H}: G \rightarrow G / H$ as being factored via a normal subgroup $K$ of $G, K \leq H \leq G$, to give

$$
\gamma_{H}=\gamma_{H / K} \gamma_{K}
$$

up to a natural isomorphism, as illustrated in Fig. 34.8. Another way of visualizing this theorem is to use the subgroup diagram in Fig. 34.9, where each group is a normal subgroup of $G$ and is contained in the one above it. The larger the normal subgroup, the smaller the factor group. Thus we can think of $G$ collapsed by $H$, that is, $G / H$, as being smaller than $G$ collapsed by $K$. Theorem 34.7 states that we can collapse $G$ all the way down to $G / H$ in two steps. First, collapse to $G / K$, and then, using $H / K$, collapse this to $(G / K) /(H / K)$. The overall result is the same (up to isomorphism) as collapsing $G$ by $H$.

34.10 Example

Consider $K=6 \mathbb{Z}<H=2 \mathbb{Z}<G=\mathbb{Z}$. Then $G / H=\mathbb{Z} / 2 \mathbb{Z} \simeq \mathbb{Z}_{2}$. Now $G / K$ $=\mathbb{Z} / 6 \mathbb{Z}$ has elements

$$
6 \mathbb{Z}, \quad 1+6 \mathbb{Z}, \quad 2+6 \mathbb{Z}, \quad 3+6 \mathbb{Z}, \quad 4+6 \mathbb{Z}, \quad \text { and } \quad 5+6 \mathbb{Z}
$$

Of these six cosets, $6 \mathbb{Z}, 2+6 \mathbb{Z}$, and $4+6 \mathbb{Z}$ lie in $2 \mathbb{Z} / 6 \mathbb{Z}$. Thus $(\mathbb{Z} / 6 \mathbb{Z}) /(2 \mathbb{Z} / 6 \mathbb{Z})$ has two elements and is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ also. Alternatively, we see that $\mathbb{Z} / 6 \mathbb{Z} \simeq \mathbb{Z}_{6}$, and $2 \mathbb{Z} / 6 \mathbb{Z}$ corresponds under this isomorphism to the cyclic subgroup $\langle 2\rangle$ of $\mathbb{Z}_{6}$. Thus $(\mathbb{Z} / 6 \mathbb{Z}) /(2 \mathbb{Z} / 6 \mathbb{Z}) \simeq \mathbb{Z}_{6} /\langle 2\rangle \simeq \mathbb{Z}_{2} \simeq \mathbb{Z} / 2 \mathbb{Z}$

## EXERCISES 34

## Computations

In using the three isomorphism theorems, it is often necessary to know the actual correspondence given by the isomorphism and not just the fact that the groups are isomorphic. The first six exercises give us training for this.

6. Repeat Exercise 5 for the group $G=\mathbb{Z}_{36}$ with $H=\langle 9\rangle$ and $K=\langle 18\rangle$.

## Theory

7. Show directly from the definition of a normal subgroup that if $H$ and $N$ are subgroups of a group $G$, and $N$ is normal in $G$, then $H \cap N$ is normal in $H$.

## SECTION 35 Series of Groups

## Subnormal and Normal Series

This section is concerned with the notion of a series of a group $G$, which gives insight into the structure of $G$. The results hold for both abelian and nonabelian groups. They are not too important for finitely generated abelian groups because of our strong Theorem 11.12. Many of our illustrations will be taken from abelian groups, however, for ease of computation.

35.1 Definition A subnormal (or subinvariant) series of a group $G$ is a finite sequence $H_{0}, H_{1}, \cdots, H_{n}$ of subgroups of $G$ such that $H_{i}<H_{i+1}$ and $H_{i}$ is a normal subgroup of $H_{i+1}$ with $H_{0}=$ $\{e\}$ and $H_{n}=G$. A normal (or invariant) series of $G$ is a finite sequence $H_{0}, H_{1}, \cdots, H_{n}$ of normal subgroups of $G$ such that $H_{i}<H_{i+1}, H_{0}=\{e\}$, and $H_{n}=G$.

Note that for abelian groups the notions of subnormal and normal series coincide, since every subgroup is normal. A normal series is always subnormal, but the converse need not be true. We defined a subnormal series before a normal series, since the concept of a subnormal series is more important for our work.

35.2 Example Two examples of normal series of $\mathbb{Z}$ under addition are

$$
\{0\}<8 \mathbb{Z}<4 \mathbb{Z}<\mathbb{Z}
$$

and

$$
\{0\}<9 \mathbb{Z}<\mathbb{Z} \text {. }
$$

35.3 Example Consider the group $D_{4}$ of symmetries of the square in Example 8.10. The series

$$
\left\{\rho_{0}\right\}<\left\{\rho_{0}, \mu_{1}\right\}<\left\{\rho_{0}, \rho_{2}, \mu_{1}, \mu_{2}\right\}<D_{4}
$$

is a subnormal series, as we could check using Table 8.12. It is not a normal series since $\left\{\rho_{0}, \mu_{1}\right\}$ is not normal in $D_{4}$.

35.4 Definition A subnormal (normal) series $\left\{K_{j}\right\}$ is a refinement of a subnormal (normal) series $\left\{H_{i}\right\}$ of a group $G$ if $\left\{H_{i}\right\} \subseteq\left\{K_{j}\right\}$, that is, if each $H_{i}$ is one of the $K_{j}$.

35.5 Example The series

$$
\{0\}<72 \mathbb{Z}<24 \mathbb{Z}<8 \mathbb{Z}<4 \mathbb{Z}<\mathbb{Z}
$$

is a refinement of the series

$$
\{0\}<72 \mathbb{Z}<8 \mathbb{Z}<\mathbb{Z}
$$

Two new terms, $4 \mathbb{Z}$ and $24 \mathbb{Z}$, have been inserted.

Of interest in studying the structure of $G$ are the factor groups $H_{i+1} / H_{i}$. These are defined for both normal and subnormal series, since $H_{i}$ is normal in $H_{i+1}$ in either case.

35.6 Definition Two subnormal (normal) series $\left\{H_{i}\right\}$ and $\left\{K_{j}\right\}$ of the same group $G$ are isomorphic if there is a one-to-one correspondence between the collections of factor groups $\left\{H_{i+1} / H_{i}\right\}$ and $\left\{K_{j+1} / K_{j}\right\}$ such that corresponding factor groups are isomorphic.

Clearly, two isomorphic subnormal (normal) series must have the same number of groups.

35.7 Example The two series of $\mathbb{Z}_{15}$,

$$
\{0\}<\langle 5\rangle<\mathbb{Z}_{15}
$$

and

$$
\{0\}<\langle 3\rangle<\mathbb{Z}_{15}
$$

are isomorphic. Both $\mathbb{Z}_{15} /\langle 5\rangle$ and $\langle 3\rangle /\{0\}$ are isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_{5}$, and $\mathbb{Z}_{15} /\langle 3\rangle$ is isomorphic to $\langle 5\rangle /\{0\}$, or to $\mathbb{Z}_{3}$.

## The Schreier Theorem

We proceed to prove that two subnormal series of a group $G$ have isomorphic refinements. This is a fundamental result in the theory of series. The proof is not too difficult. However, we know from experience that some students get lost in the proof, and then tend to feel that they cannot understand the theorem. We now give an illustration of the theorem before we proceed to its proof.

35.8 Example Let us try to find isomorphic refinements of the series

$$
\{0\}<8 \mathbb{Z}<4 \mathbb{Z}<\mathbb{Z}
$$

and

$$
\{0\}<9 \mathbb{Z}<\mathbb{Z}
$$

given in Example 35.2. Consider the refinement

$$
\{0\}<72 \mathbb{Z}<8 \mathbb{Z}<4 \mathbb{Z}<\mathbb{Z}
$$

of $\{0\}<8 \mathbb{Z}<4 \mathbb{Z}<\mathbb{Z}$ and the refinement

$$
\{0\}<72 \mathbb{Z}<18 \mathbb{Z}<9 \mathbb{Z}<\mathbb{Z}
$$

of $\{0\}<9 \mathbb{Z}<\mathbb{Z}$. In both cases the refinements have four factor groups isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_{4}, \mathbb{Z}_{2}, \mathbb{Z}_{9}$, and $72 \mathbb{Z}$ or $\mathbb{Z}$. The order in which the factor groups occur is different to be sure.

We start with a rather technical lemma developed by Zassenhaus. This lemma is sometimes called the butterfly lemma, since Fig. 35.9, which accompanies the lemma, has a butterfly shape.

Let $H$ and $K$ be subgroups of a group $G$, and let $H^{*}$ be a normal subgroup of $H$ and $K^{*}$ be a normal subgroup of $K$. Applying the first statement in Lemma 34.4 to $H^{*}$ and $H \cap K$ as subgroups of $H$, we see that $H^{*}(H \cap K)$ is a group. Similar arguments show that $H^{*}\left(H \cap K^{*}\right), K^{*}(H \cap K)$, and $K^{*}\left(H^{*} \cap K\right)$ are also groups. It is not hard to show that $H^{*} \cap K$ is a normal subgroup of $H \cap K$ (see Exercise 22). The same argument using Lemma 34.4 applied to $H^{*} \cap K$ and $H \cap K^{*}$ as subgroups of $H \cap K$ shows that $L=\left(H^{*} \cap K\right)\left(H \cap K^{*}\right)$ is a group. Thus we have the diagram of subgroups shown in Fig. 35.9. It is not hard to verify the inclusion relations indicated by the diagram.

Since both $H \cap K^{*}$ and $H^{*} \cap K$ are normal subgroups of $H \cap K$, the second statement in Lemma 34.4 shows that $L=\left(H^{*} \cap K\right)\left(H \cap K^{*}\right)$ is a normal subgroup of $H \cap K$. We have denoted this particular normal subgroup relationship by the heavy middle line in Fig. 35.9. We claim the other two heavy lines also indicate normal subgroup relationships, and that the three factor groups given by the three normal subgroup relations are all isomorphic. To show this, we shall define a homomorphism $\phi: H^{*}(H \cap K) \rightarrow(H \cap K) / L$, and show that $\phi$ is onto $(H \cap K) / L$ with kernel $H^{*}\left(H \cap K^{*}\right)$. It will then follow at once from Theorem 34.2 that $H^{*}\left(H \cap K^{*}\right)$ is normal

in $H^{*}(H \cap K)$, and that $H^{*}(H \cap K) / H^{*}\left(H \cap K^{*}\right) \simeq(H \cap K) / L$. A similar result for the groups on the right-hand heavy line in Fig. 35.9 then follows by symmetry.

Let $\phi: H^{*}(H \cap K) \rightarrow(H \cap K) / L$ be defined as follows. For $h \in H^{*}$ and $x \in$ $H \cap K$, let $\phi(h x)=x L$. We show $\phi$ is well-defined and a homomorphism. Let $h_{1}, h_{2} \in$ $H^{*}$ and $x_{1}, x_{2} \in H \cap K$. If $h_{1} x_{1}=h_{2} x_{2}$, then $h_{2}^{-1} h_{1}=x_{2} x_{1}{ }^{-1} \in H^{*} \cap(H \cap K)=$ $H^{*} \cap K \subseteq L$, so $x_{1} L=x_{2} L$. Thus $\phi$ is well defined. Since $H^{*}$ is normal in $H$, there is $h_{3}$ in $H^{*}$ such that $x_{1} h_{2}=h_{3} x_{1}$. Then

$$
\begin{aligned}
\phi\left(\left(h_{1} x_{1}\right)\left(h_{2} x_{2}\right)\right) & =\phi\left(\left(h_{1} h_{3}\right)\left(x_{1} x_{2}\right)\right)=\left(x_{1} x_{2}\right) L \\
& =\left(x_{1} L\right)\left(x_{2} L\right)=\phi\left(h_{1} x_{1}\right) \cdot \phi\left(h_{2} x_{2}\right) .
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus $\phi$ is a homomorphism.

Obviously $\phi$ is onto $(H \cap K) / L$. Finally if $h \in H^{*}$ and $x \in H \cap K$, then $\phi(h x)=$ $x L=L$ if and only if $x \in L$, or if and only if $h x \in H^{*} L=H^{*}\left(H^{*} \cap K\right)\left(H \cap K^{*}\right)=$ $H^{*}\left(H \cap K^{*}\right)$. Thus $\operatorname{Ker}(\phi)=H^{*}\left(H \cap K^{*}\right)$.

We have proved the following lemma.

35.10 Lemma (Zassenhaus Lemma) Let $H$ and $K$ be subgroups of a group $G$ and let $H^{*}$ and $K^{*}$ be normal subgroups of $H$ and $K$, respectively. Then

1. $H^{*}\left(H \cap K^{*}\right)$ is a normal subgroup of $H^{*}(H \cap K)$.
2. $K^{*}\left(H^{*} \cap K\right)$ is a normal subgroup of $K^{*}(H \cap K)$.
3. $H^{*}(H \cap K) / H^{*}\left(H \cap K^{*}\right) \simeq K^{*}(H \cap K) / K^{*}\left(H^{*} \cap K\right)$

$$
\simeq(H \cap K) /\left[\left(H^{*} \cap K\right)\left(H \cap K^{*}\right)\right] .
$$

35.11 Theorem (Schreier Theorem) Two subnormal (normal) series of a group $G$ have isomorphic refinements.

Proof Let $G$ be a group and let

$$
\{e\}=H_{0}<H_{1}<H_{2}<\cdots<H_{n}=G
$$

and

$$
\{e\}=K_{0}<K_{1}<K_{2}<\cdots<K_{m}=G
$$

be two subnormal series for $G$. For $i$ where $0 \leq i \leq n-1$, form the chain of groups

$$
H_{i}=H_{i}\left(H_{i+1} \cap K_{0}\right) \leq H_{i}\left(H_{i+1} \cap K_{1}\right) \leq \cdots \leq H_{i}\left(H_{i+1} \cap K_{m}\right)=H_{i+1} .
$$

This inserts $m-1$ not necessarily distinct groups between $H_{i}$ and $H_{i+1}$. If we do this for each $i$ where $0 \leq i \leq n-1$ and let $H_{i, j}=H_{i}\left(H_{i+1} \cap K_{j}\right)$, then we obtain the chain of groups

$$
\begin{aligned}
\{e\}=H_{0,0} & \leq H_{0,1} \leq H_{0,2} \leq \cdots \leq H_{0, m-1} \leq H_{1,0} \\
& \leq H_{1,1} \leq H_{1,2} \leq \cdots \leq H_{1, m-1} \leq H_{2,0} \\
& \leq H_{2,1} \leq H_{2,2} \leq \cdots \leq H_{2, m-1} \leq H_{3,0} \\
& \leq \cdots \\
& \leq H_{n-1,1} \leq H_{n-1,2} \leq \cdots \leq H_{n-1, m-1} \leq H_{n-1, m} \\
& =G
\end{aligned}
$$

This chain (3) contains $n m+1$ not necessarily distinct groups, and $H_{i, 0}=H_{i}$ for each $i$. By the Zassenhaus lemma, chain (3) is a subnormal chain, that is, each group is normal in the following group. This chain refines the series (1).

In a symmetric fashion, we set $K_{j, i}=K_{j}\left(K_{j+1} \cap H_{i}\right)$ for $0 \leq j \leq m-1$ and $0 \leq$ $i \leq n$. This gives a subnormal chain

$$
\begin{aligned}
\{e\}=K_{0,0} & \leq K_{0,1} \leq K_{0,2} \leq \cdots \leq K_{0, n-1} \leq K_{1,0} \\
& \leq K_{1,1} \leq K_{1,2} \leq \cdots \leq K_{1, n-1} \leq K_{2,0} \\
& \leq K_{2,1} \leq K_{2,2} \leq \cdots \leq K_{2, n-1} \leq K_{3,0} \\
& \leq \cdots \\
& \leq K_{m-1,1} \leq K_{m-1,2} \leq \cdots \leq K_{m-1, n-1} \leq K_{m-1, n} \\
& =G
\end{aligned}
$$

This chain (4) contains $m n+1$ not necessarily distinct groups, and $K_{j, 0}=K_{j}$ for each $j$. This chain refines the series (2).

By the Zassenhaus lemma 35.10, we have

$$
H_{i}\left(H_{i+1} \cap K_{j+1}\right) / H_{i}\left(H_{i+1} \cap K_{j}\right) \simeq K_{j}\left(K_{j+1} \cap H_{i+1}\right) / K_{j}\left(K_{j+1} \cap H_{i}\right),
$$

or

$$
H_{i, j+1} / H_{i, j} \simeq K_{j, i+1} / K_{j, i}

for $0 \leq i \leq n-1$ and $0 \leq j \leq m-1$. The isomorphisms of relation (5) give a oneto-one correspondence of isomorphic factor groups between the subnormal chains (3) and (4). To verify this correspondence, note that $H_{i, 0}=H_{i}$ and $H_{i, m}=H_{i+1}$, while $K_{j, 0}=K_{j}$ and $K_{j, n}=K_{j+1}$. Each chain in (3) and (4) contains a rectangular array of $m n$ symbols $\leq$. Each $\leq$ gives rise to a factor group. The factor groups arising from the $r$ th row of $\leq$ 's in chain (3) correspond to the factor groups arising from the $r$ th column of $\leq$ 's in chain (4). Deleting repeated groups from the chains in (3) and (4), we obtain subnormal series of distinct groups that are isomorphic refinements of chains (1) and (2). This establishes the theorem for subnormal series.

For normal series, where all $H_{i}$ and $K_{j}$ are normal in $G$, we merely observe that all the groups $H_{i, j}$ and $K_{j, i}$ formed above are also normal in $G$, so the same proof applies. This normality of $H_{i, j}$ and $K_{j, i}$ follows at once from the second assertion in Lemma 34.4 and from the fact that intersections of normal subgroups of a group yield normal subgroups.

## The Jordan-Hölder Theorem

We now come to the real meat of the theory.

A subnormal series $\left\{H_{i}\right\}$ of a group $G$ is a composition series if all the factor groups $H_{i+1} / H_{i}$ are simple. A normal series $\left\{H_{i}\right\}$ of $G$ is a principal or chief series if all the factor groups $H_{i+1} / H_{i}$ are simple.

Note that for abelian groups the concepts of composition and principal series coincide. Also, since every normal series is subnormal, every principal series is a composition series for any group, abelian or not.

35.13 Example We claim that $\mathbb{Z}$ has no composition (and also no principal) series. For if

$$
\{0\}=H_{0}<H_{1}<\cdots<H_{n-1}<H_{n}=\mathbb{Z}
$$

is a subnormal series, $H_{1}$ must be of the form $r \mathbb{Z}$ for some $r \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}$. But then $H_{1} / H_{0}$ is isomorphic to $r \mathbb{Z}$, which is infinite cyclic with many nontrivial proper normal subgroups, for example, $2 r \mathbb{Z}$. Thus $\mathbb{Z}$ has no composition (and also no principal) series.

35.14 Example The series

$$
\{e\}<A_{n}<S_{n}
$$

for $n \geq 5$ is a composition series (and also a principal series) of $S_{n}$, because $A_{n} /\{e\}$ is isomorphic to $A_{n}$, which is simple for $n \geq 5$, and $S_{n} / A_{n}$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$, which is simple. Likewise, the two series given in Example 35.7 are composition series (and also principal series) of $\mathbb{Z}_{15}$. They are isomorphic, as shown in that example. This illustrates our main theorem, which will be stated shortly.

Observe that by Theorem 15.18, $H_{i+1} / H_{i}$ is simple if and only if $H_{i}$ is a maximal normal subgroup of $H_{i+1}$. Thus for a composition series, each $H_{i}$ must be a maximal normal subgroup of $H_{i+1}$. To form a composition series of a group $G$, we just hunt for a maximal normal subgroup $H_{n-1}$ of $G$, then for a maximal normal subgroup $H_{n-2}$ of $H_{n-1}$, and so on. If this process terminates in a finite number of steps, we have a composition series. Note that by Theorem 15.18, a composition series cannot have any further refinement. To form a principal series, we have to hunt for a maximal normal subgroup $H_{n-1}$ of $G$, then for a maximal normal subgroup $H_{n-2}$ of $H_{n-1}$ that is also normal in $G$, and so on. The main theorem is as follows.

35.15 Theorem (Jordan-Hölder Theorem) Any two composition (principal) series of a group $G$ are isomorphic.

Proof Let $\left\{H_{i}\right\}$ and $\left\{K_{i}\right\}$ be two composition (principal) series of $G$. By Theorem 35.11, they have isomorphic refinements. But since all factor groups are already simple, Theorem 15.18 shows that neither series has any further refinement. Thus $\left\{H_{i}\right\}$ and $\left\{K_{i}\right\}$ must already be isomorphic.

For a finite group, we should regard a composition series as a type of factorization of the group into simple factor groups, analogous to the factorization of a positive integer into primes. In both cases, the factorization is unique, up to the order of the factors.

## Historical Note

$\mathrm{T}$ his first appearance of what became the JordanHölder theorem occurred in 1869 in a commentary on the work of Galois by the brilliant French algebraist Camille Jordan (1838-1922). The context of its appearance is the study of permutation groups associated with the roots of polynomial equations. Jordan asserted that even though the sequence of normal subgroups $G, I, J, \cdots$ of the group of the equation is not necessarily unique, nevertheless the sequence of indices of this composition series is unique. Jordan gave a proof in his monumental 1870 Treatise on Substitutions and Algebraic Equations. This latter work, though restricted to what we now call permutation groups, remained the standard treatise on group theory for many years

The Hölder part of the theorem, that the sequence of factor groups in a composition series is unique up to order, was due to Otto Hölder (1859-1937), who played a very important role in the development of group theory once the completely abstract definition of a group had been given. Among his other contributions, he gave the first abstract definition of a "factor group" and determined the structure of all finite groups of square-free order.

35.16 Theorem If $G$ has a composition (principal) series, and if $N$ is a proper normal subgroup of $G$, then there exists a composition (principal) series containing $N$.

Proof The series

$$
\{e\}<N<G
$$

is both a subnormal and a normal series. Since $G$ has a composition series $\left\{H_{i}\right\}$, then by Theorem 35.11 there is a refinement of $\{e\}<N<G$ to a subnormal series isomorphic to a refinement of $\left\{H_{i}\right\}$. But as a composition series, $\left\{H_{i}\right\}$ can have no further refinement. Thus $\{e\}<N<G$ can be refined to a subnormal series all of whose factor groups are simple, that is, to a composition series. A similar argument holds if we start with a principal series $\left\{K_{j}\right\}$ of $G$.

35.17 Example A composition (and also a principal) series of $\mathbb{Z}_{4} \times \mathbb{Z}_{9}$ containing $\langle(0,1)\rangle$ is

$$
\{(0,0)\}<\langle(0,3)\rangle<\langle(0,1)\rangle<\langle 2\rangle \times\langle 1\rangle<\langle 1\rangle \times\langle 1\rangle=\mathbb{Z}_{4} \times \mathbb{Z}_{9}
$$

The next definition is basic to the characterization of those polynomial equations whose solutions can be expressed in terms of radicals.

35.18 Definition A group $G$ is solvable if it has a composition series $\left\{H_{i}\right\}$ such that all factor groups $H_{i+1} / H_{i}$ are abelian.

By the Jordan-Hölder theorem, we see that for a solvable group, every composition series $\left\{H_{i}\right\}$ must have abelian factor groups $H_{i+1} / H_{i}$.

The group $S_{3}$ is solvable, because the composition series

$$
\{e\}<A_{3}<S_{3}
$$

has factor groups isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_{3}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$, which are abelian. The group $S_{5}$ is not solvable, for since $A_{5}$ is simple, the series

$$
\{e\}<A_{5}<S_{5}
$$

is a composition series, and $A_{5} /\{e\}$, which is isomorphic to $A_{5}$, is not abelian. This group $A_{5}$ of order 60 can be shown to be the smallest group that is not solvable. This fact is closely connected with the fact that a polynomial equation of degree 5 is not in general solvable by radicals, but a polynomial equation of degree $\leq 4$ is.

## The Ascending Central Series

We mention one subnormal series for a group $G$ that can be formed using centers of groups. Recall from Section 15 that the center $Z(G)$ of a group $G$ is defined by

$$
Z(G)=\{z \in G \mid z g=g z \text { for all } g \in G\}
$$

and that $Z(G)$ is a normal subgroup of $G$. If we have the table for a finite group $G$, it is easy to find the center. An element $a$ will be in the center of $G$ if and only if the elements in the row opposite $a$ at the extreme left are given in the same order as the elements in the column under $a$ at the very top of the table.

Now let $G$ be a group, and let $Z(G)$ be the center of $G$. Since $Z(G)$ is normal in $G$, we can form the factor group $G / Z(G)$ and find the center $Z(G / Z(G))$ of this factor group. Since $Z(G / Z(G))$ is normal in $G / Z(G)$, if $\gamma: G \rightarrow G / Z(G)$ is the canonical map, then by Theorem 15.16, $\gamma^{-1}[Z(G / Z(G))]$ is a normal subgroup $Z_{1}(G)$ of $G$. We can then form the factor group $G / Z_{1}(G)$ and find its center, take $\left(\gamma_{1}\right)^{-1}$ of it to get $Z_{2}(G)$, and so on.

The series

$$
\{e\} \leq Z(G) \leq Z_{1}(G) \leq Z_{2}(G) \leq \cdots
$$

described in the preceding discussion is the ascending central series of the group $G$.

35.21 Example The center of $S_{3}$ is just the identity $\left\{\rho_{0}\right\}$. Thus the ascending central series of $S_{3}$ is

$$
\left\{\rho_{0}\right\} \leq\left\{\rho_{0}\right\} \leq\left\{\rho_{0}\right\} \leq \cdots
$$

The center of the group $D_{4}$ of symmetries of the square in Example 8.10 is $\left\{\rho_{0}, \rho_{2}\right\}$. (Do you remember that we said that this group would give us nice examples of many things we discussed?) Since $D_{4} /\left\{\rho_{0}, \rho_{2}\right\}$ is of order 4 and hence abelian, its center is all of $D_{4} /\left\{\rho_{0}, \rho_{2}\right\}$. Thus the ascending central series of $D_{4}$ is

$$
\left\{\rho_{0}\right\} \leq\left\{\rho_{0}, \rho_{2}\right\} \leq D_{4} \leq D_{4} \leq D_{4} \leq \cdots
$$

## SeCtion 36 Sylow Theorems

The fundamental theorem for finitely generated abelian groups (Theorem 11.12) gives us complete information about all finite abelian groups. The study of finite nonabelian groups is much more complicated. The Sylow theorems give us some important information about them.

We know the order of a subgroup of a finite group $G$ must divide $|G|$. If $G$ is abelian, then there exist subgroups of every order dividing $|G|$. We showed in Example 15.6 that $A_{4}$, which has order 12 , has no subgroup of order 6 . Thus a nonabelian group $G$ may have no subgroup of some order $d$ dividing $|G|$; the "converse of the theorem of Lagrange" does not hold. The Sylow theorems give a weak converse. Namely, they show that if $d$ is a power of a prime and $d$ divides $|G|$, then $G$ does contain a subgroup of order $d$. (Note that 6 is not a power of a prime.) The Sylow theorems also give some information concerning the number of such subgroups and their relationship to each other. We will see that these theorems are very useful in studying finite nonabelian groups.

Proofs of the Sylow theorems give us another application of action of a group on a set described in Section 16. This time, the set itself is formed from the group; in some instances the set is the group itself, sometimes it is a collection of cosets of a subgroup, and sometimes it is a collection of subgroups.

## p-Groups

Section 17 gave applications of Burnside's formula that counted the number of orbits in a finite $G$-set. Most of our results in this section flow from an equation that counts the number of elements in a finite $G$-set.

Let $X$ be a finite $G$-set. Recall that for $x \in X$, the orbit of $x$ in $X$ under $G$ is $G x=\{g x \mid g \in G\}$. Suppose that there are $r$ orbits in $X$ under $G$, and let $\left\{x_{1}, x_{2}, \cdots, x_{r}\right\}$ contain one element from each orbit in $X$. Now every element of $X$ is in precisely one
orbit, so

$$
|X|=\sum_{i=1}^{r}\left|G x_{i}\right|
$$

There may be one-element orbits in $X$. Let $X_{G}=\{x \in X \mid g x=x$ for all $g \in G\}$. Thus $X_{G}$ is precisely the union of the one-element orbits in $X$. Let us suppose there are $s$ one-element orbits, where $0 \leq s \leq r$. Then $\left|X_{G}\right|=s$, and reordering the $x_{i}$ if necessary, we may rewrite Eq. (1) as

$$
|X|=\left|X_{G}\right|+\sum_{i=s+1}^{r}\left|G x_{i}\right|
$$

Most of the results of this section will flow from Eq. (2). We shall develop Sylow theory as in Hungerford [10], where credit is given to R. J. Nunke for the line of proof. The proof of Theorem 36.3 (Cauchy's theorem) is credited there to J. H. McKay.

Theorem 36.1, which follows, is not quite a counting theorem, but it does have a numerical conclusion. It counts modulo $p$. The theorem seems to be amazingly powerful. In the rest of the chapter, if we choose the correct set, the correct group action on it, and apply Theorem 36.1, what we want seems to fall right into our lap! Compared with older proofs, the arguments are extremely pretty and elegant.

Throughout this section, $p$ will always be a prime integer.

36.1 Theorem Let $G$ be a group of order $p^{n}$ and let $X$ be a finite $G$-set. Then $|X| \equiv\left|X_{G}\right|(\bmod p)$.

Proof In the notation of Eq. (2), we know that $\left|G x_{i}\right|$ divides $|G|$ by Theorem 16.16. Consequently $p$ divides $\left|G x_{i}\right|$ for $s+1 \leq i \leq r$. Equation (2) then shows that $|X|-\left|X_{G}\right|$ is divisible by $p$, so $|X| \equiv\left|X_{G}\right|(\bmod p)$.

36.2 Definition Let $p$ be a prime. A group $G$ is a $p$-group if every element in $G$ has order a power of the prime $p$. A subgroup of a group $G$ is a $p$-subgroup of $G$ if the subgroup is itself a $p$-group.

Our goal in this section is to show that a finite group $G$ has a subgroup of every prime-power order dividing $|G|$. As a first step, we prove Cauchy's theorem, which says that if $p$ divides $|G|$, then $G$ has a subgroup of order $p$.

36.3 Theorem (Cauchy's Theorem) Let $p$ be a prime. Let $G$ be a finite group and let $p$ divide $|G|$. Then $G$ has an element of order $p$ and, consequently, a subgroup of order $p$.

Proof We form the set $X$ of all $p$-tuples $\left(g_{1}, g_{2}, \cdots, g_{p}\right)$ of elements of $G$ having the property that the product of the coordinates in $G$ is $e$. That is,

$$
X=\left\{\left(g_{1}, g_{2}, \cdots, g_{p}\right) \mid g_{i} \in G \text { and } g_{1} g_{2} \cdots g_{p}=e\right\}
$$

We claim $p$ divides $|X|$. In forming a $p$-tuple in $X$, we may let $g_{1}, g_{2}, \cdots, g_{p-1}$ be any elements of $G$, and $g_{p}$ is then uniquely determined as $\left(g_{1} g_{2} \cdots g_{p-1}\right)^{-1}$. Thus $|X|=$ $|G|^{p-1}$ and since $p$ divides $|G|$, we see that $p$ divides $|X|$.

Let $\sigma$ be the cycle $(1,2,3, \cdots, p)$ in $S_{p}$. We let $\sigma$ act on $X$ by

$$
\sigma\left(g_{1}, g_{2}, \cdots, g_{p}\right)=\left(g_{\sigma(1)}, g_{\sigma(2)}, \cdots, g_{\sigma(p)}\right)=\left(g_{2}, g_{3}, \cdots, g_{p}, g_{1}\right)
$$

Note that $\left(g_{2}, g_{3}, \cdots, g_{p}, g_{1}\right) \in X$, for $g_{1}\left(g_{2} g_{3} \cdots g_{p}\right)=e$ implies that $g_{1}=\left(g_{2} g_{3} \cdots\right.$ $\left.g_{p}\right)^{-1}$, so $\left(g_{2} g_{3} \cdots g_{p}\right) g_{1}=e$ also. Thus $\sigma$ acts on $X$, and we consider the subgroup $\langle\sigma\rangle$ of $S_{p}$ to act on $X$ by iteration in the natural way.

Now $|\langle\sigma\rangle|=p$, so we may apply Theorem 36.1 , and we know that $|X| \equiv\left|X_{\langle\sigma\rangle}\right|$ $(\bmod p)$. Since $p$ divides $|X|$, it must be that $p$ divides $\left|X_{\langle\sigma\rangle}\right|$ also. Let us examine $X_{\langle\sigma\rangle}$. Now $\left(g_{1}, g_{2}, \cdots, g_{p}\right)$ is left fixed by $\sigma$, and hence by $\langle\sigma\rangle$, if and only if $g_{1}=g_{2}=\cdots=$ $g_{p}$. We know at least one element in $X_{\langle\sigma\rangle}$, namely $(e, e, \cdots, e)$. Since $p$ divides $\left|X_{\langle\sigma\rangle}\right|$, there must be at least $p$ elements in $X_{\langle\sigma\rangle}$. Hence there exists some element $a \in G, a \neq e$, such that $(a, a, \cdots, a) \in X_{\langle\sigma\rangle}$ and hence $a^{p}=e$, so $a$ has order $p$. Of course, $\langle a\rangle$ is a subgroup of $G$ of order $p$.

36.4 Corollary Let $G$ be a finite group. Then $G$ is a $p$-group if and only if $|G|$ is a power of $p$.

Proof We leave the proof of this corollary to Exercise 14.

## The Sylow Theorems

Let $G$ be a group, and let $\mathscr{S}$ be the collection of all subgroups of $G$. We make $\mathscr{S}$ into a $G$-set by letting $G$ act on $\mathscr{S}$ by conjugation. That is, if $H \in \mathscr{S}$ so $H \leq G$ and $g \in G$, then $g$ acting on $H$ yields the conjugate subgroup $g \mathrm{Hg}^{-1}$. (To avoid confusion, we will never write this action as $g H$.) Now $G_{H}=\left\{g \in G \mid g H g^{-1}=H\right\}$ is easily seen to be a subgroup of $G$ (Exercise 11), and $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G_{H}$. Since $G_{H}$ consists of all elements of $G$ that leave $H$ invariant under conjugation, $G_{H}$ is the largest subgroup of $G$ having $H$ as a normal subgroup.

36.5 Definition The subgroup $G_{H}$ just discussed is the normalizer of $H$ in $G$ and will be denoted $N[H]$ from now on.

In the proof of the lemma that follows, we will use the fact that if $H$ is a finite subgroup of a group $G$, then $g \in N[H]$ if $g h g^{-1} \in H$ for all $h \in H$. To see this, note that if $g h_{1} g^{-1}=g h_{2} g^{-1}$, then $h_{1}=h_{2}$ by cancellation in the group $G$. Thus the conjugation map $i_{g}: H \rightarrow H$ given by $i_{g}(h)=g h g^{-1}$ is one to one. Because $|H|$ is finite, $i_{g}$ must then map $H$ onto $H$, so $g H g^{-1}=H$ and $g \in N[H]$.

36.6 Lemma Let $H$ be a $p$-subgroup of a finite group $G$. Then

$$
(N[H]: H) \equiv(G: H)(\bmod p) .
$$

## Historical Note

$\mathrm{T}$ The Sylow theorems are due to the Norwegian mathematician Peter Ludvig Mejdell Sylow (1832-1918), who published them in a brief paper in 1872. Sylow stated the theorems in terms of permutation groups (since the abstract definition of a group had not yet been given). Georg Frobenius re-proved the theorems for abstract groups in 1887, even though he noted that in fact every group can be considered as a permutation group (Cayley's theorem [Theorem 8.16]). Sylow himself immediately applied the theorems to the question of solving algebraic equations and showed that any equation whose Galois group has order a power of a prime $p$ is solvable by radicals.

Sylow spent most of his professional life as a high school teacher in Halden, Norway, and was only appointed to a position at Christiana University in 1898 . He devoted eight years of his life to the project of editing the mathematical works of his countryman Niels Henrik Abel.

Proof Let $\mathscr{B}$ be the set of left cosets of $H$ in $G$, and let $H$ act on $\mathscr{B}$ by left translation, so that $h(x H)=(h x) H$. Then $\mathscr{B}$ becomes an $H$-set. Note that $|\mathscr{L}|=(G: H)$.

Let us determine $\mathscr{S}_{H}$, that is, those left cosets that are fixed under action by all elements of $H$. Now $x H=h(x H)$ if and only if $H=x^{-1} h x H$, or if and only if $x^{-1} h x \in H$. Thus $x H=h(x H)$ for all $h \in H$ if and only if $x^{-1} h x=x^{-1} h\left(x^{-1}\right)^{-1} \in H$ for all $h \in H$, or if and only if $x^{-1} \in N[H]$ (see the comment before the lemma), or if and only if $x \in N[H]$. Thus the left cosets in $\mathscr{L}_{H}$ are those contained in $N[H]$. The number of such cosets is $(N[H]: H)$, so $\left|\mathscr{D}_{H}\right|=(N[H]: H)$.

Since $H$ is a $p$-group, it has order a power of $p$ by Corollary 36.4. Theorem 36.1 then tells us that $|\mathscr{B}| \equiv\left|\mathscr{D}_{H}\right|(\bmod p)$, that is, that $(G: H) \equiv(N[H]: H)(\bmod p)$.

36.7 Corollary Let $H$ be a $p$-subgroup of a finite group $G$. If $p \operatorname{divides}(G: H)$, then $N[H] \neq H$.

Proof It follows from Lemma 36.6 that $p$ divides $(N[H]: H)$, which must then be different from 1. Thus $H \neq N[H]$.

We are now ready for the first of the Sylow theorems, which asserts the existence of prime-power subgroups of $G$ for any prime power dividing $|G|$.

36.8 Theorem (First Sylow Theorem) Let $G$ be a finite group and let $|G|=p^{n} m$ where $n \geq 1$ and where $p$ does not divide $m$. Then

1. $G$ contains a subgroup of order $p^{i}$ for each $i$ where $1 \leq i \leq n$,
2. Every subgroup $H$ of $G$ of order $p^{i}$ is a normal subgroup of a subgroup of order $p^{i+1}$ for $1 \leq i<n$.

Proof 1. We know $G$ contains a subgroup of order $p$ by Cauchy's theorem (Theorem 36.3). We use an induction argument and show that the existence of a subgroup of order $p^{i}$ for $i<n$ implies the existence of a subgroup of order $p^{i+1}$. Let $H$ be a subgroup of order $p^{i}$. Since $i<n$, we see $p$ divides $(G: H)$. By Lemma 36.6, we then know $p$ divides $(N[H]: H)$. Since $H$ is a normal
subgroup of $N[H]$, we can form $N[H] / H$, and we see that $p$ divides $|N[H] / H|$. By Cauchy's theorem, the factor group $N[H] / H$ has a subgroup $K$ which is of order $p$. If $\gamma: N[H] \rightarrow N[H] / H$ is the canonical homomorphism, then $\gamma^{-1}[K]=\{x \in N[H] \mid \gamma(x) \in K\}$ is a subgroup of $N[H]$ and hence of $G$. This subgroup contains $H$ and is of order $p^{i+1}$.

2. We repeat the construction in part 1 and note that $H<\gamma^{-1}[K] \leq N[H]$ where $\left|\gamma^{-1}[K]\right|=p^{i+1}$. Since $H$ is normal in $N[H]$, it is of course normal in the possibly smaller group $\gamma^{-1}[K]$.

36.9 Definition A Sylow $p$-subgroup $P$ of a group $G$ is a maximal $p$-subgroup of $G$, that is, a $p$-subgroup contained in no larger $p$-subgroup.

Let $G$ be a finite group, where $|G|=p^{n} m$ as in Theorem 36.8. The theorem shows that the Sylow $p$-subgroups of $G$ are precisely those subgroups of order $p^{n}$. If $P$ is a Sylow $p$-subgroup, every conjugate $g \mathrm{Pg}^{-1}$ of $P$ is also a Sylow $p$-subgroup. The second Sylow theorem states that every Sylow $p$-subgroup can be obtained from $P$ in this fashion; that is, any two Sylow $p$-subgroups are conjugate.

36.10 Theorem (Second Sylow Theorem) Let $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ be Sylow $p$-subgroups of a finite group $G$. Then $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ are conjugate subgroups of $G$.

Proof Here we will let one of the subgroups act on left cosets of the other, and use Theorem 36.1. Let $\mathscr{B}$ be the collection of left cosets of $P_{1}$, and let $P_{2}$ act on $\mathscr{S}$ by $y\left(x P_{1}\right)=(y x) P_{1}$ for $y \in P_{2}$. Then $\mathscr{B}$ is a $P_{2}$-set. By Theorem $36.1,\left|\mathscr{L}_{P_{2}}\right| \equiv|\mathscr{B}|(\bmod p)$, and $|\mathscr{B}|=\left(G: P_{1}\right)$ is not divisible by $p$, so $\left|\mathscr{S}_{P_{2}}\right| \neq 0$. Let $x P_{1} \in \mathscr{L}_{P_{2}}$. Then $y x P_{1}=x P_{1}$ for all $y \in P_{2}$, so $x^{-1} y x P_{1}=P_{1}$ for all $y \in P_{2}$. Thus $x^{-1} y x \in P_{1}$ for all $y \in P_{2}$, so $x^{-1} P_{2} x \leq P_{1}$. Since $\left|P_{1}\right|=\left|P_{2}\right|$, we must have $P_{1}=x^{-1} P_{2} x$, so $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ are indeed conjugate subgroups.

The final Sylow theorem gives information on the number of Sylow $p$-subgroups. A few illustrations are given after the theorem, and many more are given in the next section.

36.11 Theorem (Third Sylow Theorem) If $G$ is a finite group and $p$ divides $|G|$, then the number of Sylow $p$-subgroups is congruent to 1 modulo $p$ and divides $|G|$.

Proof Let $P$ be one Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$. Let $\mathscr{S}$ be the set of all Sylow $p$-subgroups and let $P$ act on $\mathscr{S}$ by conjugation, so that $x \in P$ carries $T \in \mathscr{S}$ into $x T x^{-1}$. By Theorem 36.1, $|\mathscr{S}| \equiv\left|\mathscr{S}_{P}\right|(\bmod p)$. Let us find $\mathscr{S}_{P}$. If $T \in \mathscr{S}_{P}$, then $x T x^{-1}=T$ for all $x \in P$. Thus $P \leq N[T]$. Of course $T \leq N[T]$ also. Since $P$ and $T$ are both Sylow $p$-subgroups of $G$, they are also Sylow $p$-subgroups of $N[T]$. But then they are conjugate in $N[T]$ by Theorem 36.10. Since $T$ is a normal subgroup of $N[T]$, it is its only conjugate in $N[T]$. Thus $T=P$. Then $\mathscr{S}_{P}=\{P\}$. Since $|\mathscr{S}| \equiv\left|\mathscr{S}_{P}\right|=1(\bmod p)$, we see the number of Sylow $p$-subgroups is congruent to 1 modulo $p$.

Now let $G$ act on $\mathscr{S}$ by conjugation. Since all Sylow $p$-subgroups are conjugate, there is only one orbit in $\mathscr{S}$ under $G$. If $P \in \mathscr{S}$, then $|\mathscr{S}|=\mid$ orbit of $P \mid=\left(G: G_{P}\right)$ by Theorem 16.16. ( $G_{P}$ is, in fact, the normalizer of $P$.) But $\left(G: G_{P}\right)$ is a divisor of $|G|$, so the number of Sylow $p$-subgroups divides $|G|$.
are

$$
\left\{\rho_{0}, \mu_{1}\right\}, \quad\left\{\rho_{0}, \mu_{2}\right\}, \quad\left\{\rho_{0}, \mu_{3}\right\} \text {. }
$$

Note that there are three subgroups and that $3 \equiv 1(\bmod 2)$. Also, 3 divides 6 , the order of $S_{3}$. We can readily check that

$$
i_{\rho_{2}}\left[\left\{\rho_{0}, \mu_{1}\right\}\right]=\left\{\rho_{0}, \mu_{3}\right\} \quad \text { and } \quad i_{\rho_{1}}\left[\left\{\rho_{0}, \mu_{1}\right\}\right]=\left\{\rho_{0}, \mu_{2}\right\}
$$

where $i_{\rho_{j}}(x)=\rho_{j} x \rho_{j}^{-1}$, illustrating that they are all conjugate.

36.13 Example Let us use the Sylow theorems to show that no group of order 15 is simple. Let $G$ have order 15. We claim that $G$ has a normal subgroup of order 5. By Theorem $36.8 G$ has at least one subgroup of order 5, and by Theorem 36.11 the number of such subgroups is congruent to 1 modulo 5 and divides 15 . Since 1, 6, and 11 are the only positive numbers less than 15 that are congruent to 1 modulo 5 , and since among these only the number 1 divides 15 , we see that $G$ has exactly one subgroup $P$ of order 5 . But for each $g \in G$, the inner automorphism $i_{g}$ of $G$ with $i_{g}(x)=g x g^{-1}$ maps $P$ onto a subgroup $g P g^{-1}$, again of order 5. Hence we must have $g P g^{-1}=P$ for all $g \in G$, so $P$ is a normal subgroup of $G$. Therefore, $G$ is not simple. (Example 37.10 will show that $G$ must actually be abelian and therefore must be cyclic.)

We trust that Example 36.13 gives some inkling of the power of Theorem 36.11. Never underestimate a theorem that counts something, even modulo $p$.

## section 37 Applications of the Sylow Theory

In this section we give several applications of the Sylow theorems. It is intriguing to see how easily certain facts about groups of particular orders can be deduced. However, we should realize that we are working only with groups of finite order and really making
only a small dent in the general problem of determining the structure of all finite groups. If the order of a group has only a few factors, then the techniques illustrated in this section may be of some use in determining the structure of the group. This will be demonstrated further in Section 40, where we shall show how it is sometimes possible to describe all groups (up to isomorphism) of certain orders, even when some of the groups are not abelian. However, if the order of a finite group is highly composite, that is, has a large number of factors, the problem is in general much harder.

## Applications to $\boldsymbol{p}$-Groups and the Class Equation

37.1 Theorem Every group of prime-power order (that is, every finite $p$-group) is solvable.

Proof If $G$ has order $p^{r}$, it is immediate from Theorem 36.8 that $G$ has a subgroup $H_{i}$ of order $p^{i}$ normal in a subgroup $H_{i+1}$ of order $p^{i+1}$ for $1 \leq i<r$. Then

$$
\{e\}=H_{0}<H_{1}<H_{2}<\cdots<H_{r}=G
$$

is a composition series, where the factor groups are of order $p$, and hence abelian and actually cyclic. Thus, $G$ is solvable.

The older proofs of the Sylow theorems used the class equation. The line of proof in Section 36 avoided explicit mention of the class equation, although Eq. (2) there is a general form of it. We now develop the classic class equation so you will be familiar with it.

Let $X$ be a finite $G$-set where $G$ is a finite group. Then Eq. (2) of Section 36 tells us that

$$
|X|=\left|X_{G}\right|+\sum_{i=s+1}^{r}\left|G x_{i}\right|
$$

where $x_{i}$ is an element in the $i$ th orbit in $X$. Consider now the special case of Eq. (1), where $X=G$ and the action of $G$ on $G$ is by conjugation, so $g \in G$ carries $x \in X=G$ into $\operatorname{~x~}^{-1}$. Then

$$
\begin{aligned}
X_{G} & =\left\{x \in G \mid g x g^{-1}=x \text { for all } g \in G\right\} \\
& =\{x \in G \mid x g=g x \text { for all } g \in G\}=Z(G)
\end{aligned}
$$

the center of $G$. If we let $c=|Z(G)|$ and $n_{i}=\left|G x_{i}\right|$ in Eq. (1), then we obtain

$$
|G|=c+n_{c+1}+\cdots+n_{r}
$$

where $n_{i}$ is the number of elements in the $i$ th orbit of $G$ under conjugation by itself. Note that $n_{i}$ divides $|G|$ for $c+1 \leq i \leq r$ since in Eq. (1) we know $\left|G x_{i}\right|=\left(G: G_{x_{i}}\right)$, which is a divisor of $|G|$.

37.2 Definition Equation (2) is the class equation of $G$. Each orbit in $G$ under conjugation by $G$ is a conjugate class in $G$.

37.3 Example It is readily checked that for $S_{3}$ of Example 8.7, the conjugate classes are

$$
\left\{\rho_{0}\right\}, \quad\left\{\rho_{1}, \rho_{2}\right\}, \quad\left\{\mu_{1}, \mu_{2}, \mu_{3}\right\} .
$$

The class equation of $S_{3}$ is

$$
6=1+2+3 .
$$

For illustration of the use of the class equation, we prove a theorem that Exercise 20 (b) in Section 36 asked us to prove.

37.4 Theorem The center of a finite nontrivial $p$-group $G$ is nontrivial.

Proof In Eq. (2) for $G$, each $n_{i}$ divides $|G|$ for $c+1 \leq i \leq r$, so $p$ divides each $n_{i}$, and $p$ divides $|G|$. Therefore $p$ divides $c$. Now $e \in Z(G)$, so $c \geq 1$. Therefore $c \geq p$, and there exists some $a \in Z(G)$ where $a \neq e$.

We turn now to a lemma on direct products that will be used in some of the theorems that follow.

37.5 Lemma Let $G$ be a group containing normal subgroups $H$ and $K$ such that $H \cap K=\{e\}$ and $H \vee K=G$. Then $G$ is isomorphic to $H \times K$.

Proof We start by showing that $h k=k h$ for $k \in K$ and $h \in H$. Consider the commutator $h k h^{-1} k^{-1}=\left(h k h^{-1}\right) k^{-1}=h\left(k h^{-1} k^{-1}\right)$. Since $H$ and $K$ are normal subgroups of $G$, the two groupings with parentheses show that $h k h^{-1} k^{-1}$ is in both $K$ and $H$. Since $K \cap H=\{e\}$, we see that $h k h^{-1} k^{-1}=e$, so $h k=k h$.

Let $\phi: H \times K \rightarrow G$ be defined by $\phi(h, k)=h k$. Then

$$
\begin{aligned}
\phi\left((h, k)\left(h^{\prime}, k^{\prime}\right)\right) & =\phi\left(h h^{\prime}, k k^{\prime}\right)=h h^{\prime} k k^{\prime} \\
& =h k h^{\prime} k^{\prime}=\phi(h, k) \phi\left(h^{\prime}, k^{\prime}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

so $\phi$ is a homomorphism.

If $\phi(h, k)=e$, then $h k=e$, so $h=k^{-1}$, and both $h$ and $k$ are in $H \cap K$. Thus $h=k=e$, so $\operatorname{Ker}(\phi)=\{(e, e)\}$ and $\phi$ is one to one.

By Lemma 34.4, we know that $H K=H \vee K$, and $H \vee K=G$ by hypothesis. Thus $\phi$ is onto $G$, and $H \times K \simeq G$.

37.6 Theorem For a prime number $p$, every group $G$ of order $p^{2}$ is abelian.

Proof If $G$ is not cyclic, then every element except $e$ must be of order $p$. Let $a$ be such an element. Then the cyclic subgroup $\langle a\rangle$ of order $p$ does not exhaust $G$. Also let $b \in G$ with $b \notin\langle a\rangle$. Then $\langle a\rangle \cap\langle b\rangle=\{e\}$, since an element $c$ in $\langle a\rangle \cap\langle b\rangle$ with $c \neq e$ would generate both $\langle a\rangle$ and $\langle b\rangle$, giving $\langle a\rangle=\langle b\rangle$, contrary to construction. From Theorem $36.8,\langle a\rangle$ is normal in some subgroup of order $p^{2}$ of $G$, that is, normal in all of $G$. Likewise $\langle b\rangle$ is normal in $G$. Now $\langle a\rangle \vee\langle b\rangle$ is a subgroup of $G$ properly containing $\langle a\rangle$ and of order dividing $p^{2}$. Hence $\langle a\rangle \vee\langle b\rangle$ must be all of $G$. Thus the hypotheses of Lemma 37.5 are satisfied, and $G$ is isomorphic to $\langle a\rangle \times\langle b\rangle$ and therefore abelian.

## Further Applications

We turn now to a discussion of whether there exist simple groups of certain orders. We have seen that every group of prime order is simple. We also asserted that $A_{n}$ is simple
for $n \geq 5$ and that $A_{5}$ is the smallest simple group that is not of prime order. There was a famous conjecture of Burnside that every finite simple group of nonprime order must be of even order. It was a triumph when this was proved by Thompson and Feit [21].

37.7 Theorem If $p$ and $q$ are distinct primes with $p<q$, then every group $G$ of order $p q$ has a single subgroup of order $q$ and this subgroup is normal in $G$. Hence $G$ is not simple. If $q$ is not congruent to 1 modulo $p$, then $G$ is abelian and cyclic.

Proof Theorems 36.8 and 36.11 tell us that $G$ has a Sylow $q$-subgroup and that the number of such subgroups is congruent to 1 modulo $q$ and divides $p q$, and therefore must divide $p$. Since $p<q$, the only possibility is the number 1 . Thus there is only one Sylow $q$-subgroup $Q$ of $G$. This group $Q$ must be normal in $G$, for under an inner automorphism it would be carried into a group of the same order, hence itself. Thus $G$ is not simple.

Likewise, there is a Sylow $p$-subgroup $P$ of $G$, and the number of these divides $p q$ and is congruent to 1 modulo $p$. This number must be either 1 or $q$. If $q$ is not congruent to 1 modulo $p$, then the number must be 1 and $P$ is normal in $G$. Let us assume that $q \not \equiv 1(\bmod p)$. Since every element in $Q$ other than $e$ is of order $q$ and every element in $P$ other than $e$ is of order $p$, we have $Q \cap P=\{e\}$. Also $Q \vee P$ must be a subgroup of $G$ properly containing $Q$ and of order dividing $p q$. Hence $Q \vee P=G$ and by Lemma 37.5 is isomorphic to $Q \times P$ or $\mathbb{Z}_{q} \times \mathbb{Z}_{p}$. Thus $G$ is abelian and cyclic.

We need another lemma for some of the counting arguments that follow.

37.8 Lemma $\quad$ If $H$ and $K$ are finite subgroups of a group $G$, then

$$
|H K|=\frac{(|H|)(|K|)}{|H \cap K|}
$$

Proof Recall that $H K=\{h k \mid h \in H, k \in K\}$. Let $|H|=r,|K|=s$, and $|H \cap K|=t$. Now $H K$ has at most $r s$ elements. However, it is possible for $h_{1} k_{1}$ to equal $h_{2} k_{2}$, for $h_{1}, h_{2} \in H$ and $k_{1}, k_{2} \in K$; that is, there may be some collapsing. If $h_{1} k_{1}=h_{2} k_{2}$, then let

$$
x=\left(h_{2}\right)^{-1} h_{1}=k_{2}\left(k_{1}\right)^{-1} .
$$

Now $x=\left(h_{2}\right)^{-1} h_{1}$ shows that $x \in H$, and $x=k_{2}\left(k_{1}\right)^{-1}$ shows that $x \in K$. Hence $x \in(H \cap K)$, and

$$
h_{2}=h_{1} x^{-1} \quad \text { and } \quad k_{2}=x k_{1}
$$

On the other hand, if for $y \in(H \cap K)$ we let $h_{3}=h_{1} y^{-1}$ and $k_{3}=y k_{1}$, then clearly $h_{3} k_{3}=h_{1} k_{1}$, with $h_{3} \in H$ and $k_{3} \in K$. Thus each element $h k \in H K$ can be represented in the form $h_{i} k_{i}$, for $h_{i} \in H$ and $k_{i} \in K$, as many times as there are elements of $H \cap K$, that is, $t$ times. Therefore, the number of elements in $H K$ is $r s / t$.

Lemma 37.8 is another result that counts something, so do not underestimate it. The lemma will be used in the following way: A finite group $G$ cannot have subgroups $H$ and $K$ that are too large with intersections that are too small, or the order of $H K$ would have to exceed the order of $G$, which is impossible. For example, a group of order 24 cannot have two subgroups of orders 12 and 8 with an intersection of order 2.

The remainder of this section consists of several examples illustrating techniques of proving that all groups of certain orders are abelian or that they have nontrivial proper normal subgroups, that is, that they are not simple. We will use one fact we mentioned before only in the exercises. A subgroup $H$ of index 2 in a finite group $G$ is always normal, for by counting, we see that there are only the left cosets $H$ itself and the coset consisting of all elements in $G$ not in $H$. The right cosets are the same. Thus every right coset is a left coset, and $H$ is normal in $G$.

37.9 Example No group of order $p^{r}$ for $r>1$ is simple, where $p$ is a prime. For by Theorem 36.8 such a group $G$ contains a subgroup of order $p^{r-1}$ normal in a subgroup of order $p^{r}$, which must be all of $G$. Thus a group of order 16 is not simple; it has a normal subgroup of order 8.

37.10 Example Every group of order 15 is cyclic (hence abelian and not simple, since 15 is not a prime). This is because $15=(5)(3)$, and 5 is not congruent to 1 modulo 3 . By Theorem 37.7 we are done.

37.11 Example No group of order 20 is simple, for such a group $G$ contains Sylow 5 -subgroups in number congruent to 1 modulo 5 and a divisor of 20, hence only 1. This Sylow 5 -subgroup is then normal, since all conjugates of it must be itself.

37.12 Example No group of order 30 is simple. We have seen that if there is only one Sylow $p$-subgroup for some prime $p$ dividing 30 , we are done. By Theorem 36.11 the possibilities for the number of Sylow 5-subgroups are 1 or 6, and those for Sylow 3-subgroups are 1 or 10. But if $G$ has six Sylow 5-subgroups, then the intersection of any two is a subgroup of each of order dividing 5 , and hence just $\{e\}$. Thus each contains 4 elements of order 5 that are in none of the others. Hence $G$ must contain 24 elements of order 5. Similarly, if $G$ has 10 Sylow 3-subgroups, it has at least 20 elements of order 3. The two types of Sylow subgroups together would require at least 44 elements in $G$. Thus there is a normal subgroup either of order 5 or of order 3 .

37.13 Example No group of order 48 is simple. Indeed, we shall show that a group $G$ of order 48 has a normal subgroup of either order 16 or order 8 . By Theorem $36.11 G$ has either one or three Sylow 2-subgroups of order 16. If there is only one subgroup of order 16, it is normal in $G$, by a now familiar argument.

Suppose that there are three subgroups of order 16 , and let $H$ and $K$ be two of them. Then $H \cap K$ must be of order 8 , for if $H \cap K$ were of order $\leq 4$, then by Lemma 37.8 $H K$ would have at least $(16)(16) / 4=64$ elements, contradicting the fact that $G$ has only 48 elements. Therefore, $H \cap K$ is normal in both $H$ and $K$ (being of index 2, or by Theorem 36.8). Hence the normalizer of $H \cap K$ contains both $H$ and $K$ and must have order a multiple $>1$ of 16 and a divisor of 48 , therefore 48 . Thus $H \cap K$ must be normal in $G$.

37.14 Example $\quad$ No group of order 36 is simple. Such a group $G$ has either one or four subgroups of order 9. If there is only one such subgroup, it is normal in $G$. If there are four such subgroups, let $H$ and $K$ be two of them. As in Example 37.13, $H \cap K$ must have at least 3 elements, or $H K$ would have to have 81 elements, which is impossible. Thus the normalizer of $H \cap K$ has as order a multiple of $>1$ of 9 and a divisor of 36; hence the order must
be either 18 or 36 . If the order is 18 , the normalizer is then of index 2 and therefore is normal in $G$. If the order is 36, then $H \cap K$ is normal in $G$.

37.15 Example Every group of order $255=(3)(5)(17)$ is abelian (hence cyclic by the Fundamental Theorem 11.12 and not simple, since 255 is not a prime). By Theorem 36.11 such a group $G$ has only one subgroup $H$ of order 17 . Then $G / H$ has order 15 and is abelian by Example 37.10. By Theorem 15.20, we see that the commutator subgroup $C$ of $G$ is contained in $H$. Thus as a subgroup of $H, C$ has either order 1 or 17. Theorem 36.11 also shows that $G$ has either 1 or 85 subgroups of order 3 and either 1 or 51 subgroups of order 5 . However, 85 subgroups of order 3 would require 170 elements of order 3 , and 51 subgroups of order 5 would require 204 elements of order 5 in $G$; both together would then require 375 elements in $G$, which is impossible. Hence there is a subgroup $K$ having either order 3 or order 5 and normal in $G$. Then $G / K$ has either order (5)(17) or order (3)(17), and in either case Theorem 37.7 shows that $G / K$ is abelian. Thus $C \leq K$ and has order either 3,5 , or 1 . Since $C \leq H$ showed that $C$ has order 17 or 1 , we conclude that $C$ has order 1. Hence $C=\{e\}$, and $G / C \simeq G$ is abelian. The Fundamental Theorem 11.12 then shows that $G$ is cyclic.

## Section 38 Free Abelian Groups

In this section we introduce the concept of free abelian groups and prove some results concerning them. The section concludes with a demonstration of the Fundamental Theorem of finitely generated abelian groups (Theorem 11.12).

## Free Abelian Groups

We should review the notions of a generating set for a group $G$ and a finitely generated group, as given in Section 7. In this section we shall deal exclusively with abelian groups and use additive notations as follows:

0 for the identity, + for the operation,

$$
\left.\begin{array}{c}
n a=\underbrace{a+a+\cdots+a}_{n \text { summands }} \\
-n a=\underbrace{(-a)+(-a)+\cdots+(-a)}_{n \text { summands }}
\end{array}\right\} \text { for } n \in \mathbb{Z}^{+} \text {and } a \in G .
$$

We shall continue to use the symbol $\times$ for direct product of groups rather than change to direct sum notation.

Notice that $\{(1,0),(0,1)\}$ is a generating set for the group $\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}$ since $(n, m)=n(1,0)+m(0,1)$ for any $(n, m)$ in $\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}$. This generating set has the property that each element of $\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}$ can be uniquely expressed in the form $n(1,0)+m(0,1)$. That is, the coefficients $n$ and $m$ in $\mathbb{Z}$ are unique.

38.1 Theorem Let $X$ be a subset of a nonzero abelian group $G$. The following conditions on $X$ are equivalent.

1. Each nonzero element $a$ in $G$ can be expressed uniquely (up to order of summands) in the form $a=n_{1} x_{1}+n_{2} x_{2}+\cdots+n_{r} x_{r}$ for $n_{i} \neq 0$ in $\mathbb{Z}$ and distinct $x_{i}$ in $X$.
2. $X$ generates $G$, and $n_{1} x_{1}+n_{2} x_{2}+\cdots+n_{r} x_{r}=0$ for $n_{i} \in \mathbb{Z}$ and distinct $x_{i} \in X$ if and only if $n_{1}=n_{2}=\cdots=n_{r}=0$.

Proof Suppose Condition 1 is true. Since $G \neq\{0\}$, we have $X \neq\{0\}$. It follows from 1 that $0 \notin$ $X$, for if $x_{i}=0$ and $x_{j} \neq 0$, then $x_{j}=x_{i}+x_{j}$, which would contradict the uniqueness of the expression for $x_{j}$. From Condition $1, X$ generates $G$, and $n_{1} x_{1}+n_{2} x_{2}+\cdots+n_{r} x_{r}=$ 0 if $n_{1}=n_{2}=\cdots=n_{r}=0$. Suppose that $n_{1} x_{1}+n_{2} x_{2}+\cdots+n_{r} x_{r}=0$ with some $n_{i} \neq 0$; by dropping terms with zero coefficients and renumbering, we can assume all $n_{i} \neq 0$. Then

$$
\begin{aligned}
x_{1} & =x_{1}+\left(n_{1} x_{1}+n_{2} x_{2}+\cdots+n_{r} x_{r}\right) \\
& =\left(n_{1}+1\right) x_{1}+n_{2} x_{2}+\cdots+n_{r} x_{r}
\end{aligned}
$$

which gives two ways of writing $x_{1} \neq 0$, contradicting the uniqueness assumption in Condition 1. Thus Condition 1 implies Condition 2.

We now show that Condition 2 implies Condition 1. Let $a \in G$. Since $X$ generates $G$, we see $a$ can be written in the form $a=n_{1} x_{1}+n_{2} x_{2}+\cdots+n_{r} x_{r}$. Suppose $a$ has another such expression in terms of elements of $X$. By using some zero coefficients in the two expressions, we can assume they involve the same elements in $X$ and are of the form

$$
\begin{aligned}
& a=n_{1} x_{1}+n_{2} x_{2}+\cdots n_{r} x_{r} \\
& a=m_{1} x_{1}+m_{2} x_{2}+\cdots m_{r} x_{r} .
\end{aligned}
$$

Subtracting, we obtain

$$
0=\left(n_{1}-m_{1}\right) x_{1}+\left(n_{2}-m_{2}\right) x_{2}+\cdots+\left(n_{r}-m_{r}\right) x_{r},
$$

so $n_{i}-m_{i}=0$ by Condition 2 , and $n_{i}=m_{i}$ for $i=1,2, \cdots, r$. Thus the coefficients are unique.

38.2 Definition An abelian group having a generating set $X$ satisfying the conditions described in Theorem 38.1 is a free abelian group, and $X$ is a basis for the group.

38.3 Example The group $\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}$ is free abelian and $\{(1,0),(0,1)\}$ is a basis. Similarly, a basis for the free abelian group $\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}$ is $\{(1,0,0),(0,1,0),(0,0,1)\}$, and so on. Thus finite direct products of the group $\mathbb{Z}$ with itself are free abelian groups.

38.4 Example The group $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ is not free abelian, for $n x=0$ for every $x \in \mathbb{Z}_{n}$, and $n \neq 0$, which would contradict Condition 2.

Suppose a free abelian group $G$ has a finite basis $X=\left\{x_{1}, x_{2}, \cdots, x_{r}\right\}$. If $a \in G$ and $a \neq 0$, then $a$ has a unique expression of the form

$$
a=n_{1} x_{1}+n_{2} x_{2}+\cdots+n_{r} x_{r} \quad \text { for } \quad n_{i} \in \mathbb{Z} .
$$

(Note that in the preceding expression for $a$, we included all elements $x_{i}$ of our finite basis $X$, as opposed to the expression for $a$ in Condition 1 of Theorem 38.1 where the basis may be infinite. Thus in the preceding expression for $a$ we must allow the possibility that some of the coefficients $n_{i}$ are zero, whereas in Condition 1 of Theorem 38.1, we specified that each $n_{i} \neq 0$.)

We define

$$
\phi: G \rightarrow \underbrace{\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} \times \cdots \times \mathbb{Z}}_{r \text { factors }}
$$

by $\phi(a)=\left(n_{1}, n_{2}, \cdots, n_{r}\right)$ and $\phi(0)=(0,0, \cdots, 0)$. It is straightforward to check that $\phi$ is an isomorphism. We leave the details to the exercises (see Exercise 9) and state the result as a theorem.

38.5 Theorem If $G$ is a nonzero free abelian group with a basis of $r$ elements, then $G$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} \times \cdots \times \mathbb{Z}$ for $r$ factors.

It is a fact that any two bases of a free abelian group $G$ contain the same number of elements. We shall prove this only if $G$ has a finite basis, although it is also true if every basis of $G$ is infinite. The proof is really lovely; it gives an easy characterization of the number of elements in a basis in terms of the size of a factor group.

38.6 Theorem Let $G \neq\{0\}$ be a free abelian group with a finite basis. Then every basis of $G$ is finite, and all bases of $G$ have the same number of elements.

Proof Let $G$ have a basis $\left\{x_{1}, x_{2}, \cdots, x_{r}\right\}$. Then $G$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} \times \cdots \times \mathbb{Z}$ for $r$ factors. Let $2 G=\{2 g \mid g \in G\}$. It is readily checked that $2 G$ is a subgroup of $G$. Since $G \simeq \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} \times \cdots \times \mathbb{Z}$ for $r$ factors, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
G / 2 G & \simeq(\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} \times \cdots \times \mathbb{Z}) /(2 \mathbb{Z} \times 2 \mathbb{Z} \times \cdots \times 2 \mathbb{Z}) \\
& \simeq \mathbb{Z}_{2} \times \mathbb{Z}_{2} \times \cdots \times \mathbb{Z}_{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

for $r$ factors. Thus $|G / 2 G|=2^{r}$, so the number of elements in any finite basis $X$ is $\log _{2}|G / 2 G|$. Thus any two finite bases have the same number of elements.

It remains to show that $G$ cannot also have an infinite basis. Let $Y$ be any basis for $G$, and let $\left\{y_{1}, y_{2}, \cdots, y_{s}\right\}$ be distinct elements in $Y$. Let $H$ be the subgroup of $G$ generated by $\left\{y_{1}, y_{2}, \cdots, y_{s}\right\}$, and let $K$ be the subgroup of $G$ generated by the remaining elements of $Y$. It is readily checked that $G \simeq H \times K$, so

$$
G / 2 G \simeq(H \times K) /(2 H \times 2 K) \simeq(H / 2 H) \times(K / 2 K) .
$$

Since $|H / 2 H|=2^{s}$, we see $|G / 2 G| \geq 2^{s}$. Since we have $|G / 2 G|=2^{r}$, we see that $s \leq r$. Then $Y$ cannot be an infinite set, for we could take $s>r$.

38.7 Definition If $G$ is a free abelian group, the rank of $G$ is the number of elements in a basis for $G$. (All bases have the same number of elements.)

## Proof of the Fundamental Theorem

We shall prove the Fundamental Theorem (Theorem 11.12) by showing that any finitely generated abelian group is isomorphic to a factor group of the form

$$
(\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} \times \cdots \times \mathbb{Z}) /\left(d_{1} \mathbb{Z} \times d_{2} \mathbb{Z} \times \cdots \times d_{s} \mathbb{Z} \times\{0\} \times \cdots \times\{0\}\right)
$$

where both "numerator" and "denominator" have $n$ factors, and $d_{1}$ divides $d_{2}$, which divides $d_{3} \cdots$, which divides $d_{s}$. The prime-power decomposition of Theorem 11.12 will then follow.

To show that $G$ is isomorphic to such a factor group, we will show that there is a homomorphism of $\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} \times \cdots \times \mathbb{Z}$ onto $G$ with kernel of the form $d_{1} \mathbb{Z} \times d_{2} \mathbb{Z} \times \cdots \times$ $d_{s} \mathbb{Z} \times\{0\} \times \cdots \times\{0\}$. The result will then follow by Theorem 14.11. The theorems that follow give the details of the argument. Our purpose in these introductory paragraphs is to let us see where we are going as we read what follows.

38.8 Theorem Let $G$ be a finitely generated abelian group with generating set $\left\{a_{1}, a_{2}, \cdots, a_{n}\right\}$. Let

$$
\phi: \underbrace{\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} \times \cdots \times \mathbb{Z}}_{n \text { factors }} \rightarrow G
$$

be defined by $\phi\left(h_{1}, h_{2}, \cdots, h_{n}\right)=h_{1} a_{1}+h_{2} a_{2}+\cdots+h_{n} a_{n}$. Then $\phi$ is a homomorphism onto $G$.

Proof From the meaning of $h_{i} a_{i}$ for $h_{i} \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $a_{i} \in G$, we see at once that

$$
\begin{aligned}
\phi\left[\left(h_{1}, \cdots, h_{n}\right)+\left(k_{1}, \cdots, k_{n}\right)\right] & =\phi\left(h_{1}+k_{1}, \cdots, h_{n}+k_{n}\right) \\
& =\left(h_{1}+k_{1}\right) a_{1}+\cdots+\left(h_{n}+k_{n}\right) a_{n} \\
& =\left(h_{1} a_{1}+k_{1} a_{1}\right)+\cdots+\left(h_{n} a_{n}+k_{n} a_{n}\right) \\
& =\left(h_{1} a_{1}+\cdots+h_{n} a_{n}\right)+\left(k_{1} a_{1}+\cdots+k_{n} a_{n}\right) \\
& =\phi\left(k_{1}, \cdots, k_{n}\right)+\phi\left(h_{1}, \cdots, h_{n}\right) .
\end{aligned}
$$

Since $\left\{a_{1}, \cdots, a_{n}\right\}$ generates $G$, clearly the homomorphism $\phi$ is onto $G$.

We now prove a "replacement property" that makes it possible for us to adjust a basis.

38.9 Theorem If $X=\left\{x_{1}, \cdots, x_{r}\right\}$ is a basis for a free abelian group $G$ and $t \in \mathbb{Z}$, then for $i \neq j$, the set

$$
Y=\left\{x_{1}, \cdots, x_{j-1}, x_{j}+t x_{i}, x_{j+1}, \cdots, x_{r}\right\}
$$

is also a basis for $G$.

Proof Since $x_{j}=(-t) x_{i}+(1)\left(x_{j}+t x_{i}\right)$, we see that $x_{j}$ can be recovered from $Y$, which thus also generates $G$. Suppose

$$
n_{1} x_{1}+\cdots+n_{j-1} x_{j-1}+n_{j}\left(x_{j}+t x_{i}\right)+n_{j+1} x_{j+1}+\cdots+n_{r} x_{r}=0 .
$$

Then

$$
n_{1} x_{1}+\cdots+\left(n_{i}+n_{j} t\right) x_{i}+\cdots+n_{j} x_{j}+\cdots+n_{r} x_{r}=0 .
$$

and since $X$ is a basis, $n_{1}=\cdots=n_{i}+n_{j} t=\cdots=n_{j}=\cdots=n_{r}=0$. From $n_{j}=0$ and $n_{i}+n_{j} t=0$, it follows that $n_{i}=0$ also, so $n_{1}=\cdots=n_{i}=\cdots=n_{j}=\cdots=n_{r}=$ 0 , and Condition 2 of Theorem 38.1 is satisfied. Thus $Y$ is a basis.

38.10 Example A basis for $\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}$ is $\{(1,0),(0,1)\}$. Another basis is $\{(1,0),(4,1)\}$ for $(4,1)=$ $4(1,0)+(0,1)$. However, $\{(3,0),(0,1)\}$ is not a basis. For example, we cannot express $(2,0)$ in the form $n_{1}(3,0)+n_{2}(0,1)$, for $n, n_{2} \in \mathbb{Z}$. Here $(3,0)=(1,0)+2(1,0)$, and a multiple of a basis element was added to itself, rather than to a different basis element.

A free abelian group $G$ of finite rank may have many bases. We show that if $K \leq G$, then $K$ is also free abelian with rank not exceeding that of $G$. Equally important, there exist bases of $G$ and $K$ nicely related to each other.

38.11 Theorem Let $G$ be a nonzero free abelian group of finite rank $n$, and let $K$ be a nonzero subgroup of $G$. Then $K$ is free abelian of rank $s \leq n$. Furthermore, there exists a basis $\left\{x_{1}, x_{2}, \cdots, x_{n}\right\}$ for $G$ and positive integers, $d_{1}, d_{2}, \cdots, d_{s}$ where $d_{i}$ divides $d_{i+1}$ for $i=1, \cdots, s-1$, such that $\left\{d_{1} x_{1}, d_{2} x_{2}, \cdots, d_{s} x_{s}\right\}$ is a basis for $K$.

Proof We show that $K$ has a basis of the described form, which will show that $K$ is free abelian of rank at most $n$. Suppose $Y=\left\{y_{1}, \cdots, y_{n}\right\}$ is a basis for $G$. All nonzero elements in $K$ can be expressed in the form

$$
k_{1} y_{1}+\cdots+k_{n} y_{n}
$$

where some $\left|k_{i}\right|$ is nonzero. Among all bases $Y$ for $G$, select one $Y_{1}$ that yields the minimal such nonzero value $\left|k_{i}\right|$ as all nonzero elements of $K$ are written in terms of the basis elements in $Y_{1}$. By renumbering the elements of $Y_{1}$ if necessary, we can assume there is $w_{1} \in K$ such that

$$
w_{1}=d_{1} y_{1}+k_{2} y_{2}+\cdots+k_{n} y_{n}
$$

where $d_{1}>0$ and $d_{1}$ is the minimal attainable coefficient as just described. Using the division algorithm, we write $k_{j}=d_{1} q_{j}+r_{j}$ where $0 \leq r_{j}<d_{1}$ for $j=2, \cdots, n$. Then

$$
w_{1}=d_{1}\left(y_{1}+q_{2} y_{2}+\cdots+q_{n} y_{n}\right)+r_{2} y_{2}+\cdots+r_{n} y_{n} .
$$

Now let $x_{1}=y_{1}+q_{2} y_{2}+\cdots+q_{n} y_{n}$. By Theorem $38.9\left\{x_{1}, y_{2}, \cdots, y_{n}\right\}$ is also a basis for $G$. From Eq. (1) and our choice of $Y_{1}$ for minimal coefficient $d_{1}$, we see that $r_{2}=\cdots=r_{n}=0$. Thus $d_{1} x_{1} \in K$.

We now consider bases for $G$ of the form $\left\{x_{1}, y_{2}, \cdots, y_{n}\right\}$. Each element of $K$ can be expressed in the form

$$
h_{1} x_{1}+k_{2} y_{2}+\cdots+k_{n} y_{n}
$$

Since $d_{1} x_{1} \in K$, we can subtract a suitable multiple of $d_{1} x_{1}$ and then using the minimality of $d_{1}$ to see that $h_{1}$ is a multiple of $d_{1}$, we see we actually have $k_{2} y_{2}+\cdots+k_{n} y_{n}$ in $K$. Among all such bases $\left\{x_{1}, y_{2}, \cdots, y_{n}\right\}$, we choose one $Y_{2}$ that leads to some $k_{i} \neq 0$ of minimal magnitude. (It is possible all $k_{i}$ are always zero. In this case, $K$ is generated by $d_{1} x_{1}$ and we are done.) By renumbering the elements of $Y_{2}$ we can assume that there is $w_{2} \in K$ such that

$$
w_{2}=d_{2} y_{2}+\cdots+k_{n} y_{n}
$$

where $d_{2}>0$ and $d_{2}$ is minimal as just described. Exactly as in the preceding paragraph, we can modify our basis from $Y_{2}=\left\{x_{1}, y_{2}, \cdots, y_{n}\right\}$ to a basis $\left\{x_{1}, x_{2}, y_{3}, \cdots, y_{n}\right\}$ for $G$ where $d_{1} x_{1} \in K$ and $d_{2} x_{2} \in K$. Writing $d_{2}=d_{1} q+r$ for $0 \leq r<d_{1}$, we see that $\left\{x_{1}+q x_{2}, x_{2}, y_{3}, \cdots, y_{n}\right\}$ is a basis for $G$, and $d_{1} x_{1}+d_{2} x_{2}=d_{1}\left(x_{1}+q x_{2}\right)+r x_{2}$ is in $K$. By our minimal choice of $d_{1}$, we see $r=0$, so $d_{1}$ divides $d_{2}$.

We now consider all bases of the form $\left\{x_{1}, x_{2}, y_{3}, \cdots, y_{n}\right\}$ for $G$ and examine elements of $K$ of the form $k_{3} y_{3}+\cdots+k_{n} y_{n}$. The pattern is clear. The process continues until we obtain a basis $\left\{x_{1}, x_{2}, \cdots, x_{s}, y_{s+1}, \cdots, y_{n}\right\}$ where the only element of $K$ of the form $k_{s+1} y_{s+1}+\cdots+k_{n} y_{n}$ is zero, that is, all $k_{i}$ are zero. We then let $x_{s+1}=$ $y_{s+1}, \cdots, x_{n}=y_{n}$ and obtain a basis for $G$ of the form described in the statement of Theorem 38.11.

Every finitely generated abelian group is isomorphic to a group of the form

$$
\mathbb{Z}_{m_{1}} \times \mathbb{Z}_{m_{2}} \times \cdots \times \mathbb{Z}_{m_{r}} \times \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} \times \cdots \times \mathbb{Z}
$$

where $m_{i}$ divides $m_{i+1}$ for $i=1, \cdots, r-1$.

Proof For the purposes of this proof, it will be convenient to use as notations $\mathbb{Z} / 1 \mathbb{Z}=\mathbb{Z} / \mathbb{Z} \simeq$ $\mathbb{Z}_{1}=\{0\}$. Let $G$ be finitely generated by $n$ elements. Let $F=\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} \times \cdots \times \mathbb{Z}$ for $n$ factors. Consider the homomorphism $\phi: F \rightarrow G$ of Theorem 38.8, and let $K$ be the kernel of this homomorphism. Then there is a basis for $F$ of the form $\left\{x_{1}, \cdots, x_{n}\right\}$, where $\left\{d_{1} x_{1}, \cdots, d_{s} x_{s}\right\}$ is a basis for $K$ and $d_{i}$ divides $d_{i+1}$ for $i=1, \cdots, s-1$. By Theorem 14.11, $G$ is isomorphic to $F / K$. But

$$
\begin{aligned}
F / K & \simeq(\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} \times \cdots \times \mathbb{Z}) /\left(d_{1} \mathbb{Z} \times d_{2} \mathbb{Z} \times \cdots \times d_{s} \mathbb{Z} \times\{0\} \times \cdots \times\{0\}\right) \\
& \simeq \mathbb{Z}_{d_{1}} \times \mathbb{Z}_{d_{2}} \times \cdots \times \mathbb{Z}_{d_{s}} \times \mathbb{Z} \times \cdots \times \mathbb{Z}
\end{aligned}
$$

It is possible that $d_{1}=1$, in which case $\mathbb{Z}_{d_{1}}=\{0\}$ and can be dropped (up to isomorphism) from this product. Similarly, $d_{2}$ may be 1 , and so on. We let $m_{1}$ be the first $d_{i}>1, m_{2}$ be the next $d_{i}$, and so on, and our theorem follows at once.

We have demonstrated the toughest part of the Fundamental Theorem (Theorem 11.12). Of course, a prime-power decomposition exists since we can break the groups $\mathbb{Z}_{m_{i}}$ into prime-power factors. The only remaining part of Theorem 11.12 concerns the
uniqueness of the Betti number, of the torsion coefficients, and of the prime powers. The Betti number appears as the rank of the free abelian group $G / T$, where $T$ is the torsion subgroup of $G$. This rank is invariant by Theorem 38.6 which shows the uniqueness of the Betti number. The uniqueness of the torsion coefficients and of prime powers is a bit more difficult to show. We give some exercises that indicate their uniqueness (see Exercises 14 through 22).

## Theory

9. Complete the proof of Theorem 38.5 (See the two sentences preceding the theorem).
10. Show that a free abelian group contains no nonzero elements of finite order.
11. Show that if $G$ and $G^{\prime}$ are free abelian groups, then $G \times G^{\prime}$ is free abelian.
12. Show that free abelian groups of finite rank are precisely the finitely generated abelian groups containing no nonzero elements of finite order.
13. Show that $\mathbb{Q}$ under addition is not a free abelian group. [Hint: Show that no two distinct rational numbers $n / m$ and $r / s$ could be contained in a set satisfying Condition 2 of Thorem 38.1.]

Exercises 14 through 19 deal with showing the uniqueness of the prime powers appearing in the prime-power decomposition of the torsion subgroup $T$ of a finitely generated abelian group.

14. Let $p$ be a fixed prime. Show that the elements of $T$ having as order some power of $p$, together with zero, form a subgroup $T_{p}$ of $T$.
15. Show that in any prime-power decomposition of $T$, the subgroup $T_{p}$ in the preceding exercise is isomorphic to the direct product of those cyclic factors of order some power of the prime $p$. [This reduces our problem to showing that the group $T_{p}$ cannot have essentially different decompositions into products of cyclic groups.]
16. Let $G$ be any abelian group and let $n$ be any positive integer. Show that $G[n]=\{x \in G \mid n x=0\}$ is a subgroup of $G$. (In multiplicative notation, $G[n]=\left\{x \in G \mid x^{n}=e\right\}$.)
17. Referring to Exercise 16 , show that $\mathbb{Z}_{p^{r}}[p] \simeq \mathbb{Z}_{p}$ for any $r \geq 1$ and prime $p$.
18. Using Exercise 17, show that

$$
\left(\mathbb{Z}_{p^{r_{1}}} \times \mathbb{Z}_{p^{r_{2}}} \times \cdots \times \mathbb{Z}_{p^{r_{m}}}\right)[p] \simeq \underbrace{\mathbb{Z}_{p} \times \mathbb{Z}_{p} \times \cdots \times \mathbb{Z}_{p}}_{m \text { factors }}
$$

provided each $r_{i} \geq 1$.

19. Let $G$ be a finitely generated abelian group and $T_{p}$ the subgroup defined in Exercise 14. Suppose $T_{p} \simeq \mathbb{Z}_{p^{r_{1}}} \times$ $\mathbb{Z}_{p^{r_{2}}} \times \cdots \times \mathbb{Z}_{p^{r_{m}}} \simeq \mathbb{Z}_{p^{s_{1}}} \mathbb{Z}_{p^{s_{2}}} \times \cdots \times \mathbb{Z}_{p^{s_{n}}}$, where $1 \leq r_{1} \leq r_{2} \leq \cdots \leq r_{m}$ and $1 \leq s_{1} \leq s_{2} \leq \cdots \leq s_{n}$. We need to show that $m=n$ and $r_{i}=s_{i}$ for $i=1, \cdots, n$ to complete the demonstration of uniqueness of the prime-power decomposition.

a. Use Exercise 18 to show that $n=m$.

b. Show $r_{1}=s_{1}$. Suppose $r_{i}=s_{i}$ for all $i<j$. Show $r_{j}=s_{j}$, which will complete the proof. [Hint: Suppose $r_{j}<s_{j}$. Consider the subgroup $p^{r_{j}} T_{p}=\left\{p^{r_{j}} x \mid x \in T_{p}\right\}$, and show that this subgroup would then have two prime-power decompositions involving different numbers of nonzero factors. Then argue that this is impossible by part (a) of this exercise.]

Let $T$ be the torsion subgroup of a finitely generated abelian group. Suppose $T \simeq \mathbb{Z}_{m_{1}} \times \mathbb{Z}_{m_{2}} \times \cdots \times \mathbb{Z}_{m_{r}} \simeq$ $\mathbb{Z}_{n_{1}} \times \mathbb{Z}_{n_{2}} \times \cdots \times \mathbb{Z}_{n_{s}}$, where $m_{i}$ divides $m_{i+1}$ for $i=1, \cdots, r-1$, and $n_{j}$ divides $n_{j+1}$ for $n=1, \cdots, s-1$, and $m_{1}>1$ and $n_{1}>1$. We wish to show that $r=s$ and $m_{k}=n_{k}$ for $k=1, \cdots, r$, demonstrating the uniqueness of the torsion coefficients. This is done in Exercises 20 through 22.

20. Indicate how a prime-power decomposition can be obtained from a torsion-coefficient decomposition. (Observe that the preceding exercises show the prime powers obtained are unique.)
21. Argue from Exercise 20 that $m_{r}$ and $n_{s}$ can both be characterized as follows. Let $p_{1}, \cdots, p_{t}$ be the distinct primes dividing $|T|$, and let $p_{1}{ }^{h_{1}}, \cdots, p_{t}{ }^{h_{t}}$ be the highest powers of these primes appearing in the (unique) prime-power decomposition. Then $m_{r}=n_{s}=p_{1}{ }^{h_{1}} p_{2}{ }^{h_{2}} \cdots p_{t}{ }^{h_{t}}$.
22. Characterize $m_{r-1}$ and $n_{s-1}$, showing that they are equal, and continue to show $m_{r-i}=n_{s-1}$ for $i=1, \cdots$, $r-1$, and then $r=s$.

## SECTION 39 FREE GROUPS

In this section and Section 40 we discuss a portion of group theory that is of great interest not only in algebra but in topology as well. In fact, an excellent and readable discussion of free groups and presentations of groups is found in Crowell and Fox [46, Chapters 3 and 4].

## Words and Reduced Words

Let $A$ be any (not necessarily finite) set of elements $a_{i}$ for $i \in I$. We think of $A$ as an alphabet and of the $a_{i}$ as letters in the alphabet. Any symbol of the form $a_{i}{ }^{n}$ with $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ is a syllable and a finite string $w$ of syllables written in juxtaposition is a word. We also introduce the empty word 1 , which has no syllables.

### 39.1 Example

Let $A=\left\{a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}\right\}$. Then

$$
a_{1} a_{3}^{-4} a_{2}^{2} a_{3}, \quad a_{2}^{3} a_{2}^{-1} a_{3} a_{1}^{2} a_{1}^{-7}, \quad \text { and } a_{3}^{2}
$$

are all words, if we follow the convention of understanding that $a_{i}{ }^{1}$ is the same as $a_{i}$.

There are two natural types of modifications of certain words, the elementary contractions. The first type consists of replacing an occurrence of $a_{i}{ }^{m} a_{i}{ }^{n}$ in a word by $a_{i}{ }^{m+n}$. The second type consists of replacing an occurrence of $a_{i}{ }^{0}$ in a word by 1 , that is, dropping it out of the word. By means of a finite number of elementary contractions, every word can be changed to a reduced word, one for which no more elementary contractions are possible. Note that these elementary contractions formally amount to the usual manipulations of integer exponents.

The reduced form of the word $a_{2}{ }^{3} a_{2}{ }^{-1} a_{3} a_{1}{ }^{2} a_{1}{ }^{-7}$ of Example 39.1 is $a_{2}{ }^{2} a_{3} a_{1}{ }^{-5}$.

It should be said here once and for all that we are going to gloss over several points that some books spend pages proving, usually by complicated induction arguments broken down into many cases. For example, suppose we are given a word and wish to find its reduced form. There may be a variety of elementary contractions that could be performed first. How do we know that the reduced word we end up with is the same no matter in what order we perform the elementary contractions? The student will probably say this is obvious. Some authors spend considerable effort proving this. The author tends to agree here with the student. Proofs of this sort he regards as tedious, and they have never made him more comfortable about the situation. However, the author is the first to acknowledge that he is not a great mathematician. In deference to the fact that many mathematicians feel that these things do need considerable discussion, we shall mark an occasion when we just state such facts by the phrase, "It would seem obvious that," keeping the quotation marks.

## Free Groups

Let the set of all reduced words formed from our alphabet $A$ be $F[A]$. We now make $F[A]$ into a group in a natural way. For $w_{1}$ and $w_{2}$ in $F[A]$, define $w_{1} \cdot w_{2}$ to be the reduced form of the word obtained by the juxtaposition $w_{1} w_{2}$ of the two words.

### 39.3 Example If

$$
w_{1}=a_{2}^{3} a_{1}^{-5} a_{3}^{2}
$$

and

$$
w_{2}=a_{3}^{-2} a_{1}^{2} a_{3} a_{2}^{-2},
$$

then $w_{1} \cdot w_{2}=a_{2}{ }^{3} a_{1}{ }^{-3} a_{3} a_{2}{ }^{-2}$.

"It would seem obvious that" this operation of multiplication on $F[A]$ is well defined and associative. The empty word 1 acts as an identity element. "It would seem obvious that" given a reduced word $w \in F[A]$, if we form the word obtained by first writing the syllables of $w$ in the opposite order and second by replacing each $a_{i}{ }^{n}$ by $a_{i}{ }^{-n}$, then the resulting word $w^{-1}$ is a reduced word also, and

$$
w \cdot w^{-1}=w^{-1} \cdot w=1
$$

39.4 Definition The group $F[A]$ just described is the free group generated by $A$.

Look back at Theorem 7.6 and the definition preceding it to see that the present use of the term generated is consistent with the earlier use.

Starting with a group $G$ and a generating set $\left\{a_{i} \mid i \in I\right\}$ which we will abbreviate by $\left\{a_{i}\right\}$, we might ask if $G$ is free on $\left\{a_{i}\right\}$, that is, if $G$ is essentially the free group generated by $\left\{a_{i}\right\}$. We define precisely what this is to mean.

39.5 Definition If $G$ is a group with a set $A=\left\{a_{i}\right\}$ of generators, and if $G$ is isomorphic to $F[A]$ under a map $\phi: G \rightarrow F[A]$ such that $\phi\left(a_{i}\right)=a_{i}$, then $G$ is free on $A$, and the $a_{i}$ are free generators of $G$. A group is free if it is free on some nonempty set $A$.

39.6 Example The only example of a free group that has occurred before is $\mathbb{Z}$, which is free on one generator. Note that every free group is infinite.

Refer to the literature for proofs of the next three theorems. We will not be using these results. They are stated simply to inform us of these interesting facts.

39.7 Theorem If a group $G$ is free on $A$ and also on $B$, then the sets $A$ and $B$ have the same number of elements; that is, any two sets of free generators of a free group have the same cardinality.

39.8 Definition If $G$ is free on $A$, the number of elements in $A$ is the rank of the free group $G$.

Actually, the next theorem is quite evident from Theorem 39.7.

39.9 Theorem Two free groups are isomorphic if and only if they have the same rank.

39.10 Theorem A nontrivial proper subgroup of a free group is free.

39.11 Example Let $F[\{x, y\}]$ be the free group on $\{x, y\}$. Let

$$
y_{k}=x^{k} y x^{-k}
$$

for $k \geq 0$. The $y_{k}$ for $k \geq 0$ are free generators for the subgroup of $F[\{x, y\}]$ that they generate. This illustrates that although a subgroup of a free group is free, the rank of the subgroup may be much greater than the rank of the whole group!

## Homomorphisms of Free Groups

Our work in this section will be concerned primarily with homomorphisms defined on a free group. The results here are simple and elegant.

39.12 Theorem Let $G$ be generated by $A=\left\{a_{i} \mid i \in I\right\}$ and let $G^{\prime}$ be any group. If $a_{i}{ }^{\prime}$ for $i \in I$ are any elements in $G^{\prime}$, not necessarily distinct, then there is at most one homomorphism $\phi: G \rightarrow G^{\prime}$ such that $\phi\left(a_{i}\right)=a_{i}{ }^{\prime}$. If $G$ is free on $A$, then there is exactly one such homomorphism.

Proof Let $\phi$ be a homomorphism from $G$ into $G^{\prime}$ such that $\phi\left(a_{i}\right)=a_{i}{ }^{\prime}$. Now by Theorem 7.6, for any $x \in G$ we have

$$
x=\prod_{j} a_{i_{j}}^{n_{j}}
$$

for some finite product of the generators $a_{i}$, where the $a_{i_{j}}$ appearing in the product need not be distinct. Then since $\phi$ is a homomorphism, we must have

$$
\phi(x)=\prod_{j} \phi\left(a_{i_{j}}{ }^{n_{j}}\right)=\prod_{j}\left(\mathrm{a}_{i_{j}}{ }^{\prime}\right)^{n_{j}} .
$$

Thus a homomorphism is completely determined by its values on elements of a generating set. This shows that there is at most one homomorphism such that $\phi\left(a_{i}\right)=a_{i}{ }^{\prime}$.

Now suppose $G$ is free on $A$; that is, $G=F[A]$. For

$$
x=\prod_{j} a_{i_{j}}{ }^{n_{j}}
$$

in $G$, define $\psi: G \rightarrow G^{\prime}$ by

$$
\psi(x)=\prod_{j}\left(a_{i_{j}}{ }^{\prime}\right)^{n_{j}}
$$

The map is well defined, since $F[A]$ consists precisely of reduced words; no two different formal products in $F[A]$ are equal. Since the rules for computation involving exponents in $G^{\prime}$ are formally the same as those involving exponents in $G$, it is clear that $\psi(x y)=$ $\psi(x) \psi(y)$ for any elements $x$ and $y$ in $G$, so $\psi$ is indeed a homomorphism.

Perhaps we should have proved the first part of this theorem earlier, rather than having relegated it to the exercises. Note that the theorem states that a homomorphism of a group is completely determined if we know its value on each element of a generating set. This was Exercise 46 of Section 13. In particular, a homomorphism of a cyclic group is completely determined by its value on any single generator of the group.

39.13 Theorem Every group $G^{\prime}$ is a homomorphic image of a free group $G$.

Proof Let $G^{\prime}=\left\{a_{i}{ }^{\prime} \mid i \in I\right\}$, and let $A=\left\{a_{i} \mid i \in I\right\}$ be a set with the same number of elements as $G^{\prime}$. Let $G=F[A]$. Then by Theorem 39.12 there exists a homomorphism $\psi$ mapping $G$ into $G^{\prime}$ such that $\psi\left(a_{i}\right)=a_{i}{ }^{\prime}$. Clearly the image of $G$ under $\psi$ is all of $G^{\prime}$.

## Another Look at Free Abelian Groups

It is important that we do not confuse the notion of a free group with the notion of a free abelian group. A free group on more than one generator is not abelian. In the preceding section, we defined a free abelian group as an abelian group that has a basis, that is, a generating set satisfying properties described in Theorem 38.1. There is another approach, via free groups, to free abelian groups. We now describe this approach.

Let $F[A]$ be the free group on the generating set $A$. We shall write $F$ in place of $F[A]$ for the moment. Note that $F$ is not abelian if $A$ contains more than one element. Let $C$ be the commutator subgroup of $F$. Then $F / C$ is an abelian group, and it is not hard to show that $F / C$ is free abelian with basis $\{a C \mid a \in A\}$. If $a C$ is renamed $a$, we can view $F / C$ as a free abelian group with basis $A$. This indicates how a free abelian group having a given set as basis can be constructed. Every free abelian group can be constructed in this fashion, up to isomorphism. That is, if $G$ is free abelian with basis $X$, form the free group $F[X]$, form the factor group of $F[X]$ modulo its commutator subgroup, and we have a group isomorphic to $G$.

Theorems 39.7, 39.9, and 39.10 hold for free abelian groups as well as for free groups. In fact, the abelian version of Theorem 39.10 was proved for the finite rank case in Theorem 38.11. In contrast to Example 39.11 for free groups, it is true that for a free abelian group the rank of a subgroup is at most the rank of the entire group. Theorem 38.11 also showed this for the finite rank case.

## Theory

11. Let $G$ be a finitely generated abelian group with identity 0 . A finite set $\left\{b_{1}, \cdots, b_{n}\right\}$, where $b_{i} \in G$, is a basis for $G$ if $\left\{b_{1}, \cdots, b_{n}\right\}$ generates $G$ and $\sum_{i=1}^{n} m_{i} b_{i}=0$ if and only if each $m_{i} b_{i}=0$, where $m_{i} \in \mathbb{Z}$.

d. Show that every finite abelian group has a basis $\left\{b_{1}, \cdots, b_{n}\right\}$, where the order of $b_{i}$ divides the order of $b_{i+1}$.

In present-day expositions of algebra, a frequently used technique (particularly by the disciples of N. Bourbaki) for introducing a new algebraic entity is the following:

1. Describe algebraic properties that this algebraic entity is to possess.
2. Prove that any two algebraic entities with these properties are isomorphic, that is, that these properties characterize the entity.
3. Show that at least one such entity exists.

The next three exercises illustrate this technique for three algebraic entities, each of which we have met before. So that we do not give away their identities, we use fictitious names for them in the first two exercises. The last part of these first two exercises asks us to give the usual name for the entity.

12. Let $G$ be any group. An abelian group $G^{*}$ is a blip group of $G$ if there exists a fixed homomorphism $\phi$ of $G$ onto $G^{*}$ such that each homomorphism $\psi$ of $G$ into an abelian group $G^{\prime}$ can be factored as $\psi=\theta \phi$, where $\theta$ is a homomorphism of $G^{*}$ into $G^{\prime}$ (see Fig. 39.14).

a. Show that any two blip groups of $G$ are isomorphic. [Hint: Let $G_{1}{ }^{*}$ and $G_{2}{ }^{*}$ be two blip groups of $G$. Then each of the fixed homomorphisms $\phi_{1}: G \rightarrow G_{1}{ }^{*}$ and $\phi_{2}: G \rightarrow G_{2}{ }^{*}$ can be factored via the other blip group according to the definition of a blip group; that is, $\phi_{1}=\theta_{1} \phi_{2}$ and $\phi_{2}=\theta_{2} \phi_{1}$. Show that $\theta_{1}$ is an isomorphism of $G_{2}{ }^{*}$ onto $G_{1}{ }^{*}$ by showing that both $\theta_{1} \theta_{2}$ and $\theta_{2} \theta_{1}$ are identity maps.]

b. Show for every group $G$ that a blip group $G^{*}$ of $G$ exists.

c. What concept that we have introduced before corresponds to this idea of a blip group of $G$ ?

## SECTION 40 Group Presentations

## Definition

Following most of the literature on group presentations, in this section we let 1 be the identity of a group. The idea of a group presentation is to form a group by giving a set of generators for the group and certain equations or relations that we want the generators to satisfy. We want the group to be as free as it possibly can be on the generators, subject to these relations.

40.1 Example Suppose $G$ has generators $x$ and $\mathrm{y}$ and is free except for the relation $x y=y x$, which we may express as $x y x^{-1} y^{-1}=1$. Note that the condition $x y=y x$ is exactly what is needed to make $G$ abelian, even though $x y x^{-1} y^{-1}$ is just one of the many possible commutators of $F[\{x, y\}]$. Thus $G$ is free abelian on two generators and is isomorphic to $F[\{x, y\}]$ modulo its commutator subgroup. This commutator subgroup of $F[\{x, y\}]$ is the smallest normal subgroup containing $x y x^{-1} y^{-1}$, since any normal subgroup
containing $x y x^{-1} y^{-1}$ gives rise to a factor group that is abelian and thus contains the commutator subgroup by Theorem 15.20.

The preceding example illustrates the general situation. Let $F[A]$ be a free group and suppose that we want to form a new group as much like $F[A]$ as it can be, subject to certain equations that we want satisfied. Any equation can be written in a form in which the right-hand side is 1 . Thus we can consider the equations to be $r_{i}=1$ for $i \in I$, where $r_{i} \in F[A]$. If we require that $r_{i}=1$, then we will have to have

$$
x\left(r_{i}^{n}\right) x^{-1}=1
$$

for any $x \in F[A]$ and $n \in \mathbb{Z}$. Also any product of elements equal to 1 will again have to equal 1 . Thus any finite product of the form

$$
\prod_{j} x_{j}\left(r_{i_{j}}{ }^{n_{j}}\right) x_{j}^{-1}
$$

where the $r_{i_{j}}$ need not be distinct, will have to equal 1 in the new group. It is readily checked that the set of all these finite products is a normal subgroup $R$ of $F[A]$. Thus any group looking as much as possible like $F[A]$, subject to the requirements $r_{i}=1$, also has $r=1$ for every $r \in R$. But $F[A] / R$ looks like $F[A]$ (remember that we multiply cosets by choosing representatives), except that $R$ has been collapsed to form the identity 1 . Hence the group we are after is (at least isomorphic to) $F[A] / R$. We can view this group as described by the generating set $A$ and the set $\left\{r_{i} \mid i \in I\right\}$, which we will abbreviate $\left\{r_{i}\right\}$.

## Historical Note

$\mathrm{T}$ he idea of a group presentation already appears in Arthur Cayley's 1859 paper, "On the Theory of Groups as Depending on the Symbolic Equation $\theta^{n}=1$. Third Part.' In this article, Cayley gives a complete enumeration of the five groups of order 8 , both by listing all the elements of each and by giving for each a presentation. For example, his third example is what is here called the octic group; Cayley notes that this group is generated by the two elements $\alpha, \beta$ with the relations $\alpha^{4}=1, \beta^{2}=1, \alpha \beta=\beta \alpha^{3}$. He also shows more generally that a group of order $m n$ is generated by $\alpha, \beta$ with the relations $\alpha^{m}=1, \beta^{n}=1, \alpha \beta=\beta \alpha^{s}$ if and only if $s^{n} \equiv 1(\bmod m)($ see Exercise 13$)$.

In 1878, Cayley returned to the theory of groups and noted that a central problem in that theory is the determination of all groups of a given order $n$. In the early 1890s, Otto Hölder published several papers attempting to solve Cayley's problem. Using techniques similar to those discussed in Sections 36, 37, and 40, Hölder determined all simple groups of order up to 200 and characterized all the groups of orders $p^{3}, p q^{2}, p q r$, and $p^{4}$, where $p, q, r$ are distinct prime numbers. Furthermore, he developed techniques for determining the possible structures of a group $G$, if one is given the structure of a normal subgroup $H$ and the structure of the factor group $G / H$. Interestingly, since the notion of an abstract group was still fairly new at this time, Hölder typically began his papers with the definition of a group and also emphasized that isomorphic groups are essentially one and the same object.

40.2 Definition Let $A$ be a set and let $\left\{r_{i}\right\} \subseteq F[A]$. Let $R$ be the least normal subgroup of $F[A]$ containing the $r_{i}$. An isomorphism $\phi$ of $F[A] / R$ onto a group $G$ is a presentation of $G$. The sets
$A$ and $\left\{r_{i}\right\}$ give a group presentation. The set $A$ is the set of generators for the presentation and each $r_{i}$ is a relator. Each $r \in R$ is a consequence of $\left\{r_{i}\right\}$. An equation $r_{i}=1$ is a relation. A finite presentation is one in which both $A$ and $\left\{r_{i}\right\}$ are finite sets.

This definition may seem complicated, but it really is not. In Example $40.1,\{x, y\}$ is our set of generators and $x y x^{-1} y^{-1}$ is the only relator. The equation $x y x^{-1} y^{-1}=1$, or $x y=y x$, is a relation. This was an example of a finite presentation.

If a group presentation has generators $x_{j}$ and relators $r_{i}$, we shall use the notations

$$
\left(x_{j}: r_{i}\right) \quad \text { or } \quad\left(x_{j}: r_{i}=1\right)
$$

to denote the group presentation. We may refer to $F\left[\left\{x_{j}\right\}\right] / R$ as the group with presentation $\left(x_{j}: r_{i}\right)$.

## Isomorphic Presentations

Consider the group presentation with

$$
A=\{a\} \quad \text { and } \quad\left\{r_{i}\right\}=\left\{a^{6}\right\}
$$

that is, the presentation

$$
\left(a: a^{6}=1\right) .
$$

This group defined by one generator $a$, with the relation $a^{6}=1$, is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_{6}$.

Now consider the group defined by two generators $a$ and $b$, with $a^{2}=1, b^{3}=1$, and $a b=b a$, that is, the group with presentation

$$
\left(a, b: a^{2}, b^{3}, a b a^{-1} b^{-1}\right) .
$$

The condition $a^{2}=1$ gives $a^{-1}=a$. Also $b^{3}=1$ gives $b^{-1}=b^{2}$. Thus every element in this group can be written as a product of nonnegative powers of $a$ and $b$. The relation $a b a^{-1} b^{-1}=1$, that is, $a b=b a$, allows us to write first all the factors involving $a$ and then the factors involving $b$. Hence every element of the group is equal to some $a^{m} b^{n}$. But then $a^{2}=1$ and $b^{3}=1$ show that there are just six distinct elements,

$$
1, b, b^{2}, a, a b, a b^{2} \text {. }
$$

Therefore this presentation also gives a group of order 6 that is abelian, and by the Fundamental Theorem 11.12, it must again be cyclic and isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_{6}$.

The preceding example illustrates that different presentations may give isomorphic groups. When this happens, we have isomorphic presentations. To determine whether two presentations are isomorphic may be very hard. It has been shown (see Rabin [22]) that a number of such problems connected with this theory are not generally solvable; that is, there is no routine and well-defined way of discovering a solution in all cases. These unsolvable problems include the problem of deciding whether two presentations are isomorphic, whether a group given by a presentation is finite, free, abelian, or trivial, and the famous word problem of determining whether a given word $w$ is a consequence of a given set of relations $\left\{r_{i}\right\}$.

The importance of this material is indicated by our Theorem 39.13, which guarantees that every group has a presentation.

40.4 Example Let us show that

$$
\left(x, y: y^{2} x=y, y x^{2} y=x\right)
$$

is a presentation of the trivial group of one element. We need only show that $x$ and $y$ are consequences of the relators $y^{2} x y^{-1}$ and $y x^{2} y x^{-1}$, or that $x=1$ and $y=1$ can be deduced from $y^{2} x=y$ and $y x^{2} y=x$. We illustrate both techniques.

As a consequence of $y^{2} x y^{-1}$, we get $y x$ upon conjugation by $y^{-1}$. From $y x$ we deduce $x^{-1} y^{-1}$, and then $\left(x^{-1} y^{-1}\right)\left(y x^{2} y x^{-1}\right)$ gives $x y x^{-1}$. Conjugating $x y x^{-1}$ by $x^{-1}$, we get $y$. From $y$ we get $y^{-1}$, and $y^{-1}(y x)$ is $x$.

Working with relations instead of relators, from $y^{2} x=y$ we deduce $y x=1$ upon multiplication by $y^{-1}$ on the left. Then substituting $y x=1$ into $y x^{2} y=x$, that is, $(y x)(x y)=x$, we get $x y=x$. Then multiplying by $x^{-1}$ on the left, we have $y=1$. Substituting this in $y x=1$, we get $x=1$.

Both techniques amount to the same work, but it somehow seems more natural to most of us to work with relations.

## Applications

We conclude this chapter with two applications.

40.5 Example Let us determine all groups of order 10 up to isomorphism. We know from the Fundamental Theorem 11.12 that every abelian group of order 10 is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_{10}$. Suppose that $G$ is nonabelian of order 10. By Sylow theory, $G$ contains a normal subgroup $H$ of order 5, and $H$ must be cyclic. Let $a$ be a generator of $H$. Then $G / H$ is of order 2 and thus isomorphic to $Z_{2}$. If $b \in G$ and $b \notin H$, we must then have $b^{2} \in H$. Since every element of $H$ except 1 has order 5 , if $b^{2}$ were not equal to 1 , then $b^{2}$ would have order 5 , so $b$ would have order 10 . This would mean that $G$ would be cyclic, contradicting our assumption that $G$ is not abelian. Thus $b^{2}=1$. Finally, since $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G, b H b^{-1}=H$, so in particular, $b a b^{-1} \in H$. Since conjugation by $b$ is an automorphism of $H, b a b^{-1}$ must be another element of $H$ of order 5 , hence $b a b^{-1}$ equals $a, a^{2}, a^{3}$, or $a^{4}$. But $b a b^{-1}=a$ would give $b a=a b$, and then $G$ would be abelian, since $a$ and $b$ generate $G$. Thus the possibilities for presentations of $G$ are:

1. $\left(a, b: a^{5}=1, b^{2}=1, b a=a^{2} b\right)$,
2. $\left(a, b: a^{5}=1, b^{2}=1, b a=a^{3} b\right)$,
3. $\left(a, b: a^{5}=1, b^{2}=1, b a=a^{4} b\right)$.

Note that all three of these presentations can give groups of order at most 10 , since the last relation $b a=a^{i} b$ enables us to express every product of $a$ 's and $b^{\prime}$ 's in $G$ in the form $a^{s} b^{t}$. Then $a^{5}=1$ and $b^{2}=1$ show that the set

$$
S=\left\{a^{0} b^{0}, a^{1} b^{0}, a^{2} b^{0}, a^{3} b^{0}, a^{4} b^{0}, a^{0} b^{1}, a^{1} b^{1}, a^{2} b^{1}, a^{3} b^{1}, a^{4} b^{1}\right\}
$$

includes all elements of $G$.

It is not yet clear that all these elements in $S$ are distinct, so that we have in all three cases a group of order 10. For example, the group presentation

$$
\left(a, b: a^{5}=1, b^{2}=1, b a=a^{2} b\right)
$$

gives a group in which, using the associative law, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
a & =b^{2} a=(b b) a=b(b a)=b\left(a^{2} b\right)=(b a)(a b) \\
& =\left(a^{2} b\right)(a b)=a^{2}(b a) b=a^{2}\left(a^{2} b\right) b=a^{4} b^{2}=a^{4}
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus in this group, $a=a^{4}$, so $a^{3}=1$, which, together with $a^{5}=1$, yields $a^{2}=1$. But $a^{2}=1$, together with $a^{3}=1$, means that $a=1$. Hence every element in the group with presentation

$$
\left(a, b: a^{5}=1, b^{2}=1, b a=a^{2} b\right)
$$

is equal to either 1 or $b$; that is, this group is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$. A similar study of

$$
(b b) a=b(b a)
$$

for

$$
\left(a, b: a^{5}=1, b^{2}=1, b a=a^{3} b\right)
$$

shows that $a=a^{4}$ again, so this also yields a group isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$.

This leaves just

$$
\left(a, b: a^{5}=1, b^{2}=1, b a=a^{4} b\right)
$$

as a candidate for a nonabelian group of order 10. In this case, it can be shown that all elements of $S$ are distinct, so this presentation does give a nonabelian group $G$ of order 10. How can we show that all elements in $S$ represent distinct elements of $G$ ? The easy way is to observe that we know that there is at least one nonabelian group of order 10 , the dihedral group $D_{5}$. Since $G$ is the only remaining candidate, we must have $G \simeq D_{5}$. Another attack is as follows. Let us try to make $S$ into a group by defining $\left(a^{s} b^{t}\right)\left(a^{u} b^{v}\right)$ to be $a^{x} b^{y}$, where $x$ is the remainder of $s+u\left(4^{t}\right)$ when divided by 5 , and $y$ is the remainder of $t+v$ when divided by 2 , in the sense of the division algorithm (Theorem 6.3). In other words, we use the relation $b a=a^{4} b$ as a guide in defining the product $\left(a^{s} b^{t}\right)\left(a^{u} b^{v}\right)$ of two elements of $S$. We see that $a^{0} b^{0}$ acts as identity, and that given $a^{u} b^{v}$, we can determine $t$ and $s$ successively by letting

$$
t \equiv-v(\bmod 2)
$$

and then

$$
s \equiv-u\left(4^{t}\right)(\bmod 5)
$$

giving $a^{s} b^{t}$, which is a left inverse for $a^{u} b^{v}$. We will then have a group structure on $S$ if and only if the associative law holds. Exercise 13 asks us to carry out the straight-forward computation for the associative law and to discover a condition for $S$ to be a group under such a definition of multiplication. The criterion of the exercise in this case amounts to the valid congruence

$$
4^{2} \equiv 1(\bmod 5)
$$

Thus we do get a group of order 10 . Note that

$$
2^{2} \not \equiv 1(\bmod 5)
$$

and

$$
3^{2} \not \equiv 1(\bmod 5)
$$

so Exercise 13 also shows that

$$
\left(a, b: a^{5}=1, b^{2}=1, b a=a^{2} b\right)
$$

and

$$
\left(a, b: a^{5}=1, b^{2}=1, b a=a^{3} b\right)
$$

do not give groups of order 10 .

40.6 Example Let us determine all groups of order 8 up to isomorphism. We know the three abelian ones:

$$
\mathbb{Z}_{8}, \quad \mathbb{Z}_{2} \times \mathbb{Z}_{4}, \quad \mathbb{Z}_{2} \times \mathbb{Z}_{2} \times \mathbb{Z}_{2}
$$

Using generators and relations, we shall give presentations of the nonabelian groups.

Let $G$ be nonabelian of order 8 . Since $G$ is nonabelian, it has no elements of order 8 , so each element but the identity is of order either 2 or 4 . If every element were of order 2 , then for $a, b \in G$, we would have $(a b)^{2}=1$, that is, $a b a b=1$. Then since $a^{2}=1$ and $b^{2}=1$ also, we would have

$$
b a=a^{2} b a b^{2}=a(a b)^{2} b=a b,
$$

contrary to our assumption that $G$ is not abelian. Thus $G$ must have an element of order 4

Let $\langle a\rangle$ be a subgroup of $G$ of order 4 . If $b \notin\langle a\rangle$, the cosets $\langle a\rangle$ and $b\langle a\rangle$ exhaust all of $G$. Hence $a$ and $b$ are generators for $G$ and $a^{4}=1$. Since $\langle a\rangle$ is normal in $G$ (by Sylow theory, or because it is of index 2), $G /\langle a\rangle$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ and we have $b^{2} \in\langle a\rangle$. If $b^{2}=a$ or $b^{2}=a^{3}$, then $b$ would be of order 8. Hence $b^{2}=1$ or $b^{2}=a^{2}$. Finally, since $\langle a\rangle$ is normal, we have $b a b^{-1} \in\langle a\rangle$, and since $b\langle a\rangle b^{-1}$ is a subgroup conjugate to $\langle a\rangle$ and hence isomorphic to $\langle a\rangle$, we see that $b a b^{-1}$ must be an element of order 4 . Thus $b a b^{-1}=a$ or $b a b^{-1}=a^{3}$. If $b a b^{-1}$ were equal to $a$, then $b a$ would equal $a b$, which would make $G$ abelian. Hence $b a b^{-1}=a^{3}$, so $b a=a^{3} b$. Thus we have two possibilities for $G$, namely,

$$
G_{1}:\left(a, b: a^{4}=1, b^{2}=1, b a=a^{3} b\right)
$$

and

$$
G_{2}:\left(a, b: a^{4}=1, b^{2}=a^{2}, b a=a^{3} b\right) .
$$

Note that $a^{-1}=a^{3}$, and that $b^{-1}$ is $b$ in $G_{1}$ and $b^{3}$ in $G_{2}$. These facts, along with the relation $b a=a^{3} b$, enable us to express every element in $G_{i}$ in the form $a^{m} b^{n}$, as in Examples 40.3 and 40.5. Since $a^{4}=1$ and either $b^{2}=1$ or $b^{2}=a^{2}$, the possible elements in each group are

$$
1, \quad a, \quad a^{2}, \quad a^{3}, \quad b, \quad a b, \quad a^{2} b, \quad a^{3} b
$$

Thus $G_{1}$ and $G_{2}$ each have order at most 8 . That $G_{1}$ is a group of order 8 can be seen from Exercise 13. An argument similar to that used in Exercise 13 shows that $G_{2}$ has order 8 also.

Since $b a=a^{3} b \neq a b$, we see that both $G_{1}$ and $G_{2}$ are nonabelian. That the two groups are not isomorphic follows from the fact that a computation shows that $G_{1}$ has only two elements of order 4, namely, $a$ and $a^{3}$. On the other hand, in $G_{2}$ all elements but 1 and $a^{2}$ are of order 4 . We leave the computations of the tables for these groups to Exercise 3. To illustrate suppose we wish to compute $\left(a^{2} b\right)\left(a^{3} b\right)$. Using $b a=a^{3} b$ repeatedly, we get

$$
\left(a^{2} b\right)\left(a^{3} b\right)=a^{2}(b a) a^{2} b=a^{5}(b a) a b=a^{8}(b a) b=a^{11} b^{2} .
$$

Then for $G_{1}$, we have

$$
a^{11} b^{2}=a^{11}=a^{3},
$$

but if we are in $G_{2}$, we get

$$
a^{11} b^{2}=a^{13}=a .
$$

The group $G_{1}$ is the octic group and is isomorphic to our old friend, the group $D_{4}$ of symmetries of the square. The group $G_{2}$ is the quaternion group; it is isomorphic to the multiplicative group $\{1,-1, i,-i, j,-j, k,-k\}$ of quaternions. Quaternions were discussed in Section 24.

## EXERCISES 40

## Computations

1. Give a presentation of $\mathbb{Z}_{4}$ involving one generator; involving two generators; involving three generators.
2. Give a presentation of $S_{3}$ involving three generators.
3. Give the tables for both the octic group

$$
\left(a, b: a^{4}=1, b^{2}=1, b a=a^{3} b\right)
$$

and the quaternion group

$$
\left(a, b: a^{4}=1, b^{2}=a^{2}, b a=a^{3} b\right) .
$$

In both cases, write the elements in the order $1, a, a^{2}, a^{3}, b, a b, a^{2} b, a^{3} b$. (Note that we do not have to compute every product. We know that these presentations give groups of order 8 , and once we have computed enough products the rest are forced so that each row and each column of the table has each element exactly once.)

4. Determine all groups of order 14 up to isomorphism. [Hint: Follow the outline of Example 40.5 and use Exercise 13, part (b).]
5. Determine all groups of order 21 up to isomorphism. [Hint: Follow the outline of Example 40.5 and use Exercise 13, part (b). It may seem that there are two presentations giving nonabelian groups. Show that they are isomorphic.]

## Theory

9. Use the methods of this section and Exercise 13, part (b), to show that there are no nonabelian groups of order 15. (See also Example 37.10).
10. Show, using Exercise 13, that

$$
\left(a, b: a^{3}=1, b^{2}=1, b a=a^{2} b\right)
$$

gives a group of order 6 . Show that it is nonabelian.

11. Show that the presentation

$$
\left(a, b: a^{3}=1, b^{2}=1, b a=a^{2} b\right)
$$

of Exercise 10 gives (up to isomorphism) the only nonabelian group of order 6, and hence gives a group isomorphic to $S_{3}$.

12. We showed in Example 15.6 that $A_{4}$ has no subgroup of order 6 . The preceding exercise shows that such a subgroup of $A_{4}$ would have to be isomorphic to either $\mathbb{Z}_{6}$ or $S_{3}$. Show again that this is impossible by considering orders of elements.
13. Let

$$
S=\left\{a^{i} b^{j} \mid 0 \leq i<m, 0 \leq j<n\right\},
$$

that is, $S$ consists of all formal products $a^{i} b^{j}$ starting with $a^{0} b^{0}$ and ending with $a^{m-1} b^{n-1}$. Let $r$ be a positive integer, and define multiplication on $S$ by

$$
\left(a^{s} b^{t}\right)\left(a^{u} b^{v}\right)=a^{x} b^{y},
$$

where $x$ is the remainder of $s+u\left(r^{t}\right)$ when divided by $m$, and $y$ is the remainder of $t+v$ when divided by $n$, in the sense of the division algorithm (Theorem 6.3).
a. Show that a necessary and sufficient condition for the associative law to hold and for $S$ to be a group under this multiplication is that $r^{n} \equiv 1(\bmod m)$.

b. Deduce from part (a) that the group presentation

$$
\left(a, b: a^{m}=1, b^{n}=1, b a=a^{r} b\right)
$$

gives a group of order $m n$ if and only if $r^{n} \equiv 1(\bmod m)$. (See the Historical Note on page xxx.)

14. Show that if $n=p q$, with $p$ and $q$ primes and $q>p$ and $q \equiv 1(\bmod p)$, then there is exactly one nonabelian group (up to isomorphism) of order $n$. Recall that the $q-1$ nonzero elements of $\mathbb{Z}_{q}$ form a cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}_{q}^{*}$ under multiplication modulo $q$. [Hint: The solutions of $x^{p} \equiv 1(\bmod q)$ form a cyclic subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}_{q}^{*}$ with elements $1, r, r^{2}, \cdots, r^{p-1}$. In the group with presentation $\left(a, b: a^{q}=1, b^{p}=1, b a=a^{r} b\right)$, we have $b a b^{-1}=a^{r}$, so $b^{j} a b^{-j}=a^{\left(r^{j}\right)}$. Thus, since $b^{j}$ generates $\langle b\rangle$ for $j=1, \cdots, p-1$, this presentation is isomorphic to

$$
\left(a, b^{j}: a^{q}=1,\left(b^{j}\right)^{p}=1,\left(b^{j}\right) a=a^{\left(r^{j}\right)}\left(b^{j}\right)\right)
$$

so all the presentations $\left(a, b: a^{q}=1, b^{p}=1, b a=a^{\left(r^{j}\right)} b\right)$ are isomorphic.]

# PART Factorization 

Section 45 Unique Factorization Domains<br>Section 46 Euclidean Domains<br>Section 47 Gaussian Integers and Multiplicative Norms

## SECTION 45 Unique Factorization Domains

The integral domain $\mathbb{Z}$ is our standard example of an integral domain in which there is unique factorization into primes (irreducibles). Section 23 showed that for a field $F, F[x]$ is also such an integral domain with unique factorization. In order to discuss analogous ideas in an arbitrary integral domain, we shall give several definitions, some of which are repetitions of earlier ones. It is nice to have them all in one place for reference.

45.1 Definition Let $R$ be a commutative ring with unity and let $a, b \in R$. If there exists $c \in R$ such that $b=a c$, then $a$ divides $b$ (or $a$ is a factor of $b$ ), denoted by $a \mid b$. We read $a \nmid b$ as " $a$ does not divide $b . "$

45.2 Definition An element $u$ of a commutative ring with unity $R$ is a unit of $R$ if $u$ divides 1 , that is, if $u$ has a multiplicative inverse in $R$. Two elements $a, b \in R$ are associates in $R$ if $a=b u$, where $u$ is a unit in $R$.

Exercise 27 asks us to show that this criterion for $a$ and $b$ to be associates is an equivalence relation on $R$.

45.3 Example The only units in $\mathbb{Z}$ are 1 and -1 . Thus the only associates of 26 in $\mathbb{Z}$ are 26 and -26 .

45.4 Definition A nonzero element $p$ that is not a unit of an integral domain $D$ is an irreducible of $D$ if in every factorization $p=a b$ in $D$ has the property that either $a$ or $b$ is a unit.

Note that an associate of an irreducible $p$ is again an irreducible, for if $p=u c$ for a unit $u$, then any factorization of $c$ provides a factorization of $p$.

## Historical Note

$\mathrm{T}$ The question of unique factorization in an integral domain other than the integers was first raised in public in connection with the attempted proof by Gabriel Lamé (1795-1870) of Fermat's Last Theorem, the conjecture that $x^{n}+y^{n}=z^{n}$ has no nontrivial integral solutions for $n>2$. It is not hard to show that the conjecture is true if it can be proved for all odd primes $p$. At a meeting of the Paris Academy on March 1, 1847, Lamé announced that he had proved the theorem and presented a sketch of the proof. Lamé's idea was first to factor $x^{p}+y^{p}$ over the complex numbers as

$$
\begin{aligned}
& x^{p}+y^{p}= \\
& \quad(x+y)(x+\alpha y)\left(x+\alpha^{2} y\right) \cdots\left(x+\alpha^{p-1} y\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

where $\alpha$ is a primitive $p$ th root of unity. He next proposed to show that if the factors in this expression are relatively prime and if $x^{p}+y^{p}=z^{p}$, then each of the $p$ factors must be a $p$ th power. He could then demonstrate that this Fermat equation would be true for a triple $x^{\prime}, y^{\prime}, z^{\prime}$, each number smaller than the corresponding number in the original triple. This would lead to an infinite descending sequence of positive integers, an impossibility that would prove the theorem.

After Lamé finished his announcement, however, Joseph Liouville (1809-1882) cast serious doubts on the purported proof, noting that the conclusion that each of the relatively prime factors was a $p$ th power because their product was a $p$ th power depended on the result that any integer can be uniquely factored into a product of primes. It was by no means clear that "integers" of the form $x+\alpha^{k} y$ had this unique factorization property. Although Lamé attempted to overcome Liouville's objections, the matter was settled on May 24, when Liouville produced a letter from Ernst Kummer noting that in 1844 he had already proved that unique factorization failed in the domain $\mathbb{Z}[\alpha]$, where $\alpha$ is a 23 rd root of unity.

It was not until 1994 that Fermat's Last Theorem was proved, and by techniques of algebraic geometry unknown to Lamé and Kummer. In the late 1950s, Yutaka Taniyama and Goro Shimura noticed a curious relationship between two seemingly disparate fields of mathematics, elliptic curves and modular forms. A few years after Taniyama's tragic death at age 31, Shimura clarified this idea and eventually formulated what became known as the Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture. In 1984, Gerhard Frey asserted and in 1986 Ken Ribet proved that the Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture would imply the truth of Fermat's Last Theorem. But it was finally Andrew Wiles of Princeton University who, after secretly working on this problem for seven years, gave a series of lectures at Cambridge University in June 1993 in which he announced a proof of enough of the Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture to derive Fermat's Last Theorem. Unfortunately, a gap in the proof was soon discovered, and Wiles went back to work. It took him more than a year, but with the assistance of his student Richard Taylor, he finally was able to fill the gap. The result was published in the Annals of Mathematics in May 1995, and this 350-year-old problem was now solved.

45.5 Definition An integral domain $D$ is a unique factorization domain (abbreviated UFD) if the following conditions are satisfied:

1. Every element of $D$ that is neither 0 nor a unit can be factored into a product of a finite number of irreducibles.
2. If $p_{1} \cdots p_{r}$ and $q_{1} \cdots q_{s}$ are two factorizations of the same element of $D$ into irreducibles, then $r=s$ and the $q_{j}$ can be renumbered so that $p_{i}$ and $q_{i}$ are associates.

45.6 Example Theorem 23.20 shows that for a field $F, F[x]$ is a UFD. Also we know that $\mathbb{Z}$ is a UFD; we have made frequent use of this fact, although we have never proved it. For example, in $\mathbb{Z}$ we have

$$
24=(2)(2)(3)(2)=(-2)(-3)(2)(2) \text {. }
$$

Here 2 and -2 are associates, as are 3 and -3 . Thus except for order and associates, the irreducible factors in these two factorizations of 24 are the same.

Recall that the principal ideal $\langle a\rangle$ of $D$ consists of all multiples of the element $a$. After just one more definition we can describe what we wish to achieve in this section.

45.7 Definition An integral domain $D$ is a principal ideal domain (abbreviated PID) if every ideal in $D$ is a principal ideal.

We know that $\mathbb{Z}$ is a PID because every ideal is of the form $n \mathbb{Z}$, generated by some integer $n$. Theorem 27.24 shows that if $F$ is a field, then $F[x]$ is a PID. Our purpose in this section is to prove two exceedingly important theorems:

1. Every PID is a UFD. (Theorem 45.17)
2. If $D$ is a UFD, then $D[x]$ is a UFD. (Theorem 45.29)

The fact that $F[x]$ is a UFD, where $F$ is a field (by Theorem 23.20), illustrates both theorems. For by Theorem 27.24, $F[x]$ is a PID. Also, since $F$ has no nonzero elements that are not units, $F$ satisfies our definition for a UFD. Thus Theorem 45.29 would give another proof that $F[x]$ is a UFD, except for the fact that we shall actually use Theorem 23.20 in proving Theorem 45.29. In the following section we shall study properties of a certain special class of UFDs, the Euclidean domains.

Let us proceed to prove the two theorems.

## Every PID Is a UFD

The steps leading up to Theorem 23.20 and its proof indicate the way for our proof of Theorem 45.17. Much of the material will be repetitive. We inefficiently handled the special case of $F[x]$ separately in Theorem 23.20, since it was easy and was the only case we needed for our field theory in general.

To prove that an integral domain $D$ is a UFD, it is necessary to show that both Conditions 1 and 2 of the definition of a UFD are satisfied. For our special case of $F[x]$ in Theorem 23.20, Condition 1 was very easy and resulted from an argument that in a factorization of a polynomial of degree $>0$ into a product of two nonconstant polynomials, the degree of each factor was less than the degree of the original polynomial. Thus we couldn't keep on factoring indefinitely without running into unit factors, that is, polynomials of degree 0 . For the general case of a PID, it is harder to show that this is so. We now turn to this problem. We shall need one more set-theoretic concept.

45.8 Definition If $\left\{A_{i} \mid i \in I\right\}$ is a collection of sets, then the union $\cup_{i \in I} A_{i}$ of the sets $A_{i}$ is the set of all $x$ such that $x \in A_{i}$ for at least one $i \in I$.

45.9 Lemma Let $R$ be a commutative ring and let $N_{1} \subseteq N_{2} \subseteq \cdots$ be an ascending chain of ideals $N_{i}$ in $R$. Then $N=\cup_{i} N_{i}$ is an ideal of $R$.

Proof Let $a, b \in N$. Then there are ideals $N_{i}$ and $N_{j}$ in the chain, with $a \in N_{i}$ and $b \in N_{j}$. Now either $N_{i} \subseteq N_{j}$ or $N_{j} \subseteq N_{i}$; let us assume that $N_{i} \subseteq N_{j}$, so both $a$ and $b$ are in $N_{j}$. This implies that $a \pm b$ and $a b$ are in $N_{j}$, so $a \pm b$ and $a b$ are in $N$. Taking $a=0$, we see that $b \in N$ implies $-b \in N$, and $0 \in N$ since $0 \in N_{i}$. Thus $N$ is a subring of $D$. For $a \in N$ and $d \in D$, we must have $a \in N_{i}$ for some $N_{i}$. Then since $N_{i}$ is an ideal, $d a=a d$ is in $N_{i}$. Therefore, $d a \in \cup_{i} N_{i}$, that is, $d a \in N$. Hence $N$ is an ideal.

45.10 Lemma (Ascending Chain Condition for a PID) Let $D$ be a PID. If $N_{1} \subseteq N_{2} \subseteq \cdots$ is an ascending chain of ideals $N_{i}$, then there exists a positive integer $r$ such that $N_{r}=N_{s}$ for all $s \geq r$. Equivalently, every strictly ascending chain of ideals (all inclusions proper) in a PID is of finite length. We express this by saying that the ascending chain condition (ACC) holds for ideals in a PID.

Proof By Lemma 45.9, we know that $N=\cup_{i} N_{i}$ is an ideal of $D$. Now as an ideal in $D$, which is a PID, $N=\langle c\rangle$ for some $c \in D$. Since $N=\cup_{i} N_{i}$, we must have $c \in N_{r}$, for some $r \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}$. For $s \geq r$, we have

$$
\langle c\rangle \subseteq N_{r} \subseteq N_{s} \subseteq N=\langle c\rangle .
$$

Thus $N_{r}=N_{s}$ for $s \geq r$.

The equivalence with the $\mathrm{ACC}$ is immediate.

In what follows, it will be useful to remember that for elements $a$ and $b$ of a domain $D$,

$\langle a\rangle \subseteq\langle b\rangle$ if and only if $b$ divides $a$, and

$\langle a\rangle=\langle b\rangle$ if and only if $a$ and $b$ are associates.

For the first property, note that $\langle a\rangle \subseteq\langle b\rangle$ if and only if $a \in\langle b\rangle$, which is true if and only if $a=b d$ for some $d \in D$, so that $b$ divides $a$. Using this first property, we see that $\langle a\rangle=\langle b\rangle$ if and only if $a=b c$ and $b=a d$ for some $c, d \in D$. But then $a=a d c$ and by canceling, we obtain $1=d c$. Thus $d$ and $c$ are units so $a$ and $b$ are associates.

We can now prove Condition 1 of the definition of a UFD for an integral domain that is a PID.

45.11 Theorem Let $D$ be a PID. Every element that is neither 0 nor a unit in $D$ is a product of irreducibles.

Proof Let $a \in D$, where $a$ is neither 0 nor a unit. We first show that $a$ has at least one irreducible factor. If $a$ is an irreducible, we are done. If $a$ is not an irreducible, then $a=a_{1} b_{1}$, where neither $a_{1}$ nor $b_{1}$ is a unit. Now

$$
\langle a\rangle \subset\left\langle a_{1}\right\rangle
$$

for $\langle a\rangle \subseteq\left\langle a_{1}\right\rangle$ follows from $a=a_{1} b_{1}$, and if $\langle a\rangle=\left\langle a_{1}\right\rangle$, then $a$ and $a_{1}$ would be associates and $b_{1}$ would be a unit, contrary to construction. Continuing this procedure then,
starting now with $a_{1}$, we arrive at a strictly ascending chain of ideals

$$
\langle a\rangle \subset\left\langle a_{1}\right\rangle \subset\left\langle a_{2}\right\rangle \subset \cdots .
$$

By the ACC in Lemma 45.10, this chain terminates with some $\left\langle a_{r}\right\rangle$, and $a_{r}$ must then be irreducible. Thus $a$ has an irreducible factor $a_{r}$.

By what we have just proved, for an element $a$ that is neither 0 nor a unit in $D$, either $a$ is irreducible or $a=p_{1} c_{1}$ for $p_{1}$ an irreducible and $c_{1}$ not a unit. By an argument similar to the one just made, in the latter case we can conclude that $\langle a\rangle \subset\left\langle c_{1}\right\rangle$. If $c_{1}$ is not irreducible, then $c_{1}=p_{2} c_{2}$ for an irreducible $p_{2}$ with $c_{2}$ not a unit. Continuing, we get a strictly ascending chain of ideals

$$
\langle a\rangle \subset\left\langle c_{1}\right\rangle \subset\left\langle c_{2}\right\rangle \subset \cdots .
$$

This chain must terminate, by the ACC in Lemma 45.10, with some $c_{r}=q_{r}$ that is an irreducible. Then $a=p_{1} p_{2} \cdots p_{r} q_{r}$.

This completes our demonstration of Condition 1 of the definition of a UFD. Let us turn to Condition 2. Our arguments here are parallel to those leading to Theorem 23.20. The results we encounter along the way are of some interest in themselves.

45.12 Lemma (Generalization of Theorem 27.25) An ideal $\langle p\rangle$ in a PID is maximal if and only if $p$ is an irreducible.

Proof Let $\langle p\rangle$ be a maximal ideal of $D$, a PID. Suppose that $p=a b$ in $D$. Then $\langle p\rangle \subseteq\langle a\rangle$. Suppose that $\langle a\rangle=\langle p\rangle$. Then $a$ and $p$ would be associates, so $b$ must be a unit. If $\langle a\rangle \neq\langle p\rangle$, then we must have $\langle a\rangle=\langle 1\rangle=D$, since $\langle p\rangle$ is maximal. But then $a$ and 1 are associates, so $a$ is a unit. Thus, if $p=a b$, either $a$ or $b$ must be a unit. Hence $p$ is an irreducible of $D$.

Conversely, suppose that $p$ is an irreducible in $D$. Then if $\langle p\rangle \subseteq\langle a\rangle$, we must have $p=a b$. Now if $a$ is a unit, then $\langle a\rangle=\langle 1\rangle=D$. If $a$ is not a unit, then $b$ must be a unit, so there exists $u \in D$ such that $b u=1$. Then $p u=a b u=a$, so $\langle a\rangle \subseteq\langle p\rangle$, and we have $\langle a\rangle=\langle p\rangle$. Thus $\langle p\rangle \subseteq\langle a\rangle$ implies that either $\langle a\rangle=D$ or $\langle a\rangle=\langle p\rangle$, and $\langle p\rangle \neq D$ or $p$ would be a unit. Hence $\langle p\rangle$ is a maximal ideal.

45.13 Lemma (Generalization of Theorem 27.27) In a PID, if an irreducible $p$ divides $a b$, then either $p \mid a$ or $p \mid b$.

Proof Let $D$ be a PID and suppose that for an irreducible $p$ in $D$ we have $p \mid a b$. Then $(a b) \in\langle p\rangle$. Since every maximal ideal in $D$ is a prime ideal by Corollary 27.16, $(a b) \in\langle p\rangle$ implies that either $a \in\langle p\rangle$ or $b \in\langle p\rangle$, giving either $p \mid a$ or $p \mid b$.

45.14 Corollary If $p$ is an irreducible in a PID and $p$ divides the product $a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}$ for $a_{i} \in D$, then $p \mid a_{i}$ for at least one $i$.

Proof Proof of this corollary is immediate from Lemma 45.13 if we use mathematical induction.

45.15 Definition A nonzero nonunit element $p$ of an integral domain $D$ is a prime if, for all $a, b \in D$, $p \mid a b$ implies either $p \mid a$ or $p \mid b$.

Lemma 45.13 focused our attention on the defining property of a prime. In Exercises 25 and 26, we ask you to show that a prime in an integral domain is always an irreducible and that in a UFD an irreducible is also a prime. Thus the concepts of prime and irreducible coincide in a UFD. Example 45.16 will exhibit an integral domain containing some irreducibles that are not primes, so the concepts do not coincide in every domain.

45.16 Example $\quad$ Let $F$ be a field and let $D$ be the subdomain $F\left[x^{3}, x y, y^{3}\right]$ of $F[x, y]$. Then $x^{3}$, $x y$, and $y^{3}$ are irreducibles in $D$, but

$$
\left(x^{3}\right)\left(y^{3}\right)=(x y)(x y)(x y) .
$$

Since $x y$ divides $x^{3} y^{3}$ but not $x^{3}$ or $y^{3}$, we see that $x y$ is not a prime. Similar arguments show that neither $x^{3}$ nor $y^{3}$ is a prime.

The defining property of a prime is precisely what is needed to establish uniqueness of factorization, Condition 2 in the definition of a UFD. We now complete the proof of Theorem 45.17 by demonstrating the uniqueness of factorization in a PID.

45.17 Theorem (Generalization of Theorem 23.20) Every PID is a UFD.

Proof Theorem 45.11 shows that if $D$ is a PID, then each $a \in D$, where $a$ is neither 0 nor a unit, has a factorization

$$
a=p_{1} p_{2} \cdots p_{r}
$$

into irreducibles. It remains for us to show uniqueness. Let

$$
a=q_{1} q_{2} \cdots q_{s}
$$

be another such factorization into irreducibles. Then we have $p_{1} \mid\left(q_{1} q_{2} \cdots q_{s}\right)$, which implies that $p_{1} \mid q_{j}$ for some $j$ by Corollary 45.14. By changing the order of the $q_{j}$ if necessary, we can assume that $j=1$ so $p_{1} \mid q_{1}$. Then $q_{1}=p_{1} u_{1}$, and since $p_{1}$ is an irreducible, $u_{1}$ is a unit, so $p_{1}$ and $q_{1}$ are associates. We have then

$$
p_{1} p_{2} \cdots p_{r}=p_{1} u_{1} q_{2} \cdots q_{s},
$$

so by the cancellation law in $D$,

$$
p_{2} \cdots p_{r}=u_{1} q_{2} \cdots q_{s} .
$$

Continuing this process, starting with $p_{2}$ and so on, we finally arrive at

$$
1=u_{1} u_{2} \cdots u_{r} q_{r+1} \cdots q_{s}
$$

Since the $q_{j}$ are irreducibles, we must have $r=s$.

Example 45.31 at the end of this section will show that the converse to Theorem 45.17 is false. That is, a UFD need not be a PID.

Many algebra texts start by proving the following corollary of Theorem 45.17. We have assumed that you were familiar with this corollary and used it freely in our other work.

45.18 Corollary (Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic) The integral domain $\mathbb{Z}$ is a UFD.

Proof We have seen that all ideals in $\mathbb{Z}$ are of the form $n \mathbb{Z}=\langle n\rangle$ for $n \in \mathbb{Z}$. Thus $\mathbb{Z}$ is a PID, and Theorem 45.17 applies.

It is worth noting that the proof that $\mathbb{Z}$ is a PID was really way back in Corollary 6.7. We proved Theorem 6.6 by using the division algorithm for $\mathbb{Z}$ exactly as we proved, in Theorem 27.24, that $F[x]$ is a PID by using the division algorithm for $F[x]$. In Section 46, we shall examine this parallel more closely.

## If $D$ Is a UFD, then $D[x]$ Is a UFD

We now start the proof of Theorem 45.29, our second main result for this section. The idea of the argument is as follows. Let $D$ be a UFD. We can form a field of quotients $F$ of $D$. Then $F[x]$ is a UFD by Theorem 23.20, and we shall show that we can recover a factorization for $f(x) \in D[x]$ from its factorization in $F[x]$. It will be necessary to compare the irreducibles in $F[x]$ with those in $D[x]$, of course. This approach, which we prefer as more intuitive than some more efficient modern ones, is essentially due to Gauss.

45.19 Definition Let $D$ be a UFD and let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \cdots, a_{n}$ be nonzero elements of $D$. An element $d$ of $D$ is a greatest common divisor (abbreviated gcd) of all of the $a_{i}$ if $d \mid a_{i}$ for $i=1, \cdots, n$ and any other $d^{\prime} \in D$ that divides all the $a_{i}$ also divides $d$.

In this definition, we called $d$ "a" gcd rather than "the" gcd because gcd's are only defined up to units. Suppose that $d$ and $d^{\prime}$ are two gcd's of $a_{i}$ for $i=1, \cdots, n$. Then $d \mid d^{\prime}$ and $d^{\prime} \mid d$ by our definition. Thus $d=q^{\prime} d^{\prime}$ and $d^{\prime}=q d$ for some $q, q^{\prime} \in D$, so $1 d=q^{\prime} q d$. By cancellation in $D$, we see that $q^{\prime} q=1$ so $q$ and $q^{\prime}$ are indeed units.

The technique in the example that follows shows that gcd's exist in a UFD.

45.20 Example Let us find a gcd of $420,-168$, and 252 in the UFD $\mathbb{Z}$. Factoring, we obtain $420=2^{2}$. $3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7,-168=2^{3} \cdot(-3) \cdot 7$, and $252=2^{2} \cdot 3^{2} \cdot 7$. We choose one of these numbers, say 420 , and find the highest power of each of its irreducible factors (up to associates) that divides all the numbers, $420,-168$ and 252 in our case. We take as gcd the product of these highest powers of irreducibles. For our example, these powers of irreducible factors of 420 are $2^{2}, 3^{1}, 5^{0}$, and $7^{1}$ so we take as $\operatorname{gcd} d=4 \cdot 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 7=84$. The only other gcd of these numbers in $\mathbb{Z}$ is -84 , because 1 and -1 are the only units.

Execution of the technique in Example 45.20 depends on being able to factor an element of a UFD into a product of irreducibles. This can be a tough job, even in $\mathbb{Z}$. Section 46 will exhibit a technique, the Euclidean Algorithm, that will allow us to find gcd's without factoring in a class of UFD's that includes $\mathbb{Z}$ and $F[x]$ for a field $F$.

45.21 Definition Let $D$ be a UFD. A nonconstant polynomial

$$
f(x)=a_{0}+a_{1} x+\cdots+a_{n} x^{n}
$$

in $D[x]$ is primitive if 1 is a ged of the $a_{i}$ for $i=0,1, \cdots, n$.

45.22 Example In $\mathbb{Z}[x], 4 x^{2}+3 x+2$ is primitive, but $4 x^{2}+6 x+2$ is not, since 2 , a nonunit in $\mathbb{Z}$, is a common divisor of 4,6 , and 2 .

Observe that every nonconstant irreducible in $D[x]$ must be a primitive polynomial.

45.23 Lemma If $D$ is a UFD, then for every nonconstant $f(x) \in D[x]$ we have $f(x)=(c) g(x)$, where $c \in D, g(x) \in D[x]$, and $g(x)$ is primitive. The element $c$ is unique up to a unit factor in $D$ and is the content of $f(x)$. Also $g(x)$ is unique up to a unit factor in $D$.

Proof Let $f(x) \in D[x]$ be given where $f(x)$ is a nonconstant polynomial with coefficients $a_{0}, a_{1}, \cdots, a_{n}$. Let $c$ be a gcd of the $a_{i}$ for $i=0,1, \cdots, n$. Then for each $i$, we have $a_{i}=c q_{i}$ for some $q_{i} \in D$. By the distributive law, we have $f(x)=(c) g(x)$, where no irreducible in $D$ divides all of the coefficients $q_{0}, q_{1}, \cdots, q_{n}$ of $g(x)$. Thus $g(x)$ is a primitive polynomial.

For uniqueness, if also $f(x)=(d) h(x)$ for $d \in D, h(x) \in D[x]$, and $h(x)$ primitive, then each irreducible factor of $c$ must divide $d$ and conversely. By setting $(c) g(x)=$ $(d) h(x)$ and canceling irreducible factors of $c$ into $d$, we arrive at $(u) g(x)=(v) h(x)$ for a unit $u \in D$. But then $v$ must be a unit of $D$ or we would be able to cancel irreducible factors of $v$ into $u$. Thus $u$ and $v$ are both units, so $c$ is unique up to a unit factor. From $f(x)=(c) g(x)$, we see that the primitive polynomial $g(x)$ is also unique up to a unit factor.

45.24 Example $\quad$ In $\mathbb{Z}[x]$,

$$
4 x^{2}+6 x-8=(2)\left(2 x^{2}+3 x-4\right)
$$

where $2 x^{3}+3 x-4$ is primitive.

45.25 Lemma (Gauss's Lemma) If $D$ is a UFD, then a product of two primitive polynomials in $D[x]$ is again primitive.

Proof Let

$$
f(x)=a_{0}+a_{1} x+\cdots+a_{n} x^{n}
$$

and

$$
g(x)=b_{0}+b_{1} x+\cdots+b_{m} x^{m}
$$

be primitive in $D[x]$, and let $h(x)=f(x) g(x)$. Let $p$ be an irreducible in $D$. Then $p$ does not divide all $a_{i}$ and $p$ does not divide all $b_{j}$, since $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are primitive. Let $a_{r}$ be the first coefficient of $f(x)$ not divisible by $p$; that is, $p \mid a_{i}$ for $i<r$, but $p \nmid a_{r}$ (that is, $p$ does not divide $a_{r}$ ). Similarly, let $p \mid b_{j}$ for $j<s$, but $p \nmid b_{s}$. The coefficient of $x^{r+s}$ in $h(x)=f(x) g(x)$ is

$$
c_{r+s}=\left(a_{0} b_{r+s}+\cdots+a_{r-1} b_{s+1}\right)+a_{r} b_{s}+\left(a_{r+1} b_{s-1}+\cdots+a_{r+s} b_{0}\right)
$$

Now $p \mid a_{i}$ for $i<r$ implies that

$$
p \mid\left(a_{0} b_{r+s}+\cdots+a_{r-1} b_{s+1}\right),
$$

and also $p \mid b_{j}$ for $j<s$ implies that

$$
p \mid\left(a_{r+1} b_{s-1}+\cdots+a_{r+s} b_{0}\right) .
$$

But $p$ does not divide $a_{r}$ or $b_{s}$, so $p$ does not divide $a_{r} b_{s}$, and consequently $p$ does not divide $c_{r+s}$. This shows that given an irreducible $p \in D$, there is some coefficient of $f(x) g(x)$ not divisible by $p$. Thus $f(x) g(x)$ is primitive.

45.26 Corollary If $D$ is a UFD, then a finite product of primitive polynomials in $D[x]$ is again primitive.

Proof This corollary follows from Lemma 45.25 by induction.

Now let $D$ be a UFD and let $F$ be a field of quotients of $D$. By Theorem 23.20, $F[x]$ is a UFD. As we said earlier, we shall show that $D[x]$ is a UFD by carrying a factorization in $F[x]$ of $f(x) \in D[x]$ back into one in $D[x]$. The next lemma relates the nonconstant irreducibles of $D[x]$ to those of $F[x]$. This is the last important step.

45.27 Lemma Let $D$ be a UFD and let $F$ be a field of quotients of $D$. Let $f(x) \in D[x]$, where (degree $f(x))>0$. If $f(x)$ is an irreducible in $D[x]$, then $f(x)$ is also an irreducible in $F[x]$. Also, if $f(x)$ is primitive in $D[x]$ and irreducible in $F[x]$, then $f(x)$ is irreducible in $D[x]$.

Proof Suppose that a nonconstant $f(x) \in D[x]$ factors into polynomials of lower degree in $F[x]$, that is,

$$
f(x)=r(x) s(x)
$$

for $r(x), s(x) \in F[x]$. Then since $F$ is a field of quotients of $D$, each coefficient in $r(x)$ and $s(x)$ is of the form $a / b$ for some $a, b \in D$. By clearing denominators, we can get

$$
\text { (d) } f(x)=r_{1}(x) s_{1}(x)
$$

for $d \in D$, and $r_{1}(x), s_{1}(x) \in D[x]$, where the degrees of $r_{1}(x)$ and $s_{1}(x)$ are the degrees of $r(x)$ and $s(x)$, respectively. By Lemma 45.23, $f(x)=(c) g(x), r_{1}(x)=\left(c_{1}\right) r_{2}(x)$, and $s_{1}(x)=\left(c_{2}\right) s_{2}(x)$ for primitive polynomials $g(x), r_{2}(x)$, and $s_{2}(x)$, and $c, c_{1}, c_{2} \in D$. Then

$$
(d c) g(x)=\left(c_{1} c_{2}\right) r_{2}(x) s_{2}(x),
$$

and by Lemma $45.25, r_{2}(x) s_{2}(x)$ is primitive. By the uniqueness part of Lemma 45.23, $c_{1} c_{2}=d c u$ for some unit $u$ in $D$. But then

$$
(d c) g(x)=(d c u) r_{2}(x) s_{2}(x),
$$

so

$$
f(x)=(c) g(x)=(c u) r_{2}(x) s_{2}(x) .
$$

We have shown that if $f(x)$ factors nontrivially in $F[x]$, then $f(x)$ factors nontrivially into polynomials of the same degrees in $D[x]$. Thus if $f(x) \in D[x]$ is irreducible in $D[x]$, it must be irreducible in $F[x]$.

A nonconstant $f(x) \in D[x]$ that is primitive in $D[x]$ and irreducible in $F[x]$ is also irreducible in $D[x]$, since $D[x] \subseteq F[x]$.

Lemma 45.27 shows that if $D$ is a UFD, the irreducibles in $D[x]$ are precisely the irreducibles in $D$, together with the nonconstant primitive polynomials that are irreducible in $F[x]$, where $F$ is a field of quotients of $D[x]$.

The preceding lemma is very important in its own right. This is indicated by the following corollary, a special case of which was our Theorem 23.11. (We admit that it does not seem very sensible to call a special case of a corollary of a lemma a theorem. The label assigned to a result depends somewhat on the context in which it appears.)

45.28 Corollary If $D$ is a UFD and $F$ is a field of quotients of $D$, then a nonconstant $f(x) \in D[x]$ factors into a product of two polynomials of lower degrees $r$ and $s$ in $F[x]$ if and only if it has a factorization into polynomials of the same degrees $r$ and $s$ in $D[x]$.

Proof It was shown in the proof of Lemma 45.27 that if $f(x)$ factors into a product of two polynomials of lower degree in $F[x]$, then it has a factorization into polynomials of the same degrees in $D[x]$ (see the next to last sentence of the first paragraph of the proof).

The converse holds since $D[x] \subseteq F[x]$.

We are now prepared to prove our main theorem.

45.29 Theorem If $D$ is a UFD, then $D[x]$ is a UFD.

Proof Let $f(x) \in D[x]$, where $f(x)$ is neither 0 nor a unit. If $f(x)$ is of degree 0 , we are done, since $D$ is a UFD. Suppose that (degree $f(x))>0$. Let

$$
f(x)=g_{1}(x) g_{2}(x) \cdots g_{r}(x)
$$

be a factorization of $f(x)$ in $D[x]$ having the greatest number $r$ of factors of positive degree. (There is such a greatest number of such factors because $r$ cannot exceed the degree of $f(x)$.) Now factor each $g_{i}(x)$ in the form $g_{i}(x)=c_{i} h_{i}(x)$ where $c_{i}$ is the content of $g_{i}(x)$ and $h_{i}(x)$ is a primitive polynomial. Each of the $h_{i}(x)$ is irreducible, because if it could be factored, none of the factors could lie in $D$, hence all would have positive degree leading to a corresponding factorzation of $g_{i}(x)$, and then to a factorization of $f(x)$ with more than $r$ factors of positive degree, contradicting our choice of $r$. Thus we now have

$$
f(x)=c_{1} h_{1}(x) c_{2} h_{2}(x) \cdots c_{r} h_{r}(x)
$$

where the $h_{i}(x)$ are irreducible in $D[x]$. If we now factor the $c_{i}$ into irreducibles in $D$, we obtain a factorization of $f(x)$ into a product of irreducibles in $D[x]$.

The factorization of $f(x) \in D[x]$, where $f(x)$ has degree 0 , is unique since $D$ is a UFD; see the comment following Lemma 45.27. If $f(x)$ has degree greater than 0 , we
can view any factorization of $f(x)$ into irreducibles in $D[x]$ as a factorization in $F[x]$ into units (that is, the factors in $D$ ) and irreducible polynomials in $F[x]$ by Lemma 45.27. By Theorem 23.20, these polynomials are unique, except for possible constant factors in $F$. But as an irreducible in $D[x]$, each polynomial of degree $>0$ appearing in the factorization of $f(x)$ in $D[x]$ is primitive. By the uniqueness part of Lemma 45.23, this shows that these polynomials are unique in $D[x]$ up to unit factors, that is, associates. The product of the irreducibles in $D$ in the factorization of $f(x)$ is the content of $f(x)$, which is again unique up to a unit factor by Lemma 45.23. Thus all irreducibles in $D[x]$ appearing in the factorization are unique up to order and associates.

45.30 Corollary If $F$ is a field and $x_{1}, \cdots, x_{n}$ are indeterminates, then $F\left[x_{1}, \cdots, x_{n}\right]$ is a UFD.

Proof By Theorem 23.20, $F\left[x_{1}\right]$ is a UFD. By Theorem 45.29, so is $\left(F\left[x_{1}\right]\right)\left[x_{2}\right]=F\left[x_{1}, x_{2}\right]$. Continuing in this procedure, we see (by induction) that $F\left[x_{1}, \cdots, x_{n}\right]$ is a UFD.

We have seen that a PID is a UFD. Corollary 45.30 makes it easy for us to give an example that shows that not every UFD is a PID.

45.31 Example Let $F$ be a field and let $x$ and $y$ be indeterminates. Then $F[x, y]$ is a UFD by Corollary 45.30. Consider the set $N$ of all polynomials in $x$ and $y$ in $F[x, y]$ having constant term 0 . Then $N$ is an ideal, but not a principal ideal. Thus $F[x, y]$ is not a PID.

Another example of a UFD that is not a PID is $\mathbb{Z}[x]$, as shown in Exercise 12, Section 46.

24. All our work in this section was restricted to integral domains. Taking the same definition in this section but for a commutative ring with unity, consider factorizations into irreducibles in $\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}$. What can happen? Consider in particular $(1,0)$.

## Theory

29. Let $D$ be a UFD. Show that a nonconstant divisor of a primitive polynomial in $D[x]$ is again a primitive polynomial.
30. Show that in a PID, every proper ideal is contained in a maximal ideal. [Hint: Use Lemma 45.10.]
31. Factor $x^{3}-y^{3}$ into irreducibles in $\mathbb{Q}[x, y]$ and prove that each of the factors is irreducible.

There are several other concepts often considered that are similar in character to the ascending chain condition on ideals in a ring. The following three exercises concern some of these concepts.

32. Let $R$ be any ring. The ascending chain condition (ACC) for ideals holds in $R$ if every strictly increasing sequence $N_{1} \subset N_{2} \subset N_{3} \subset \cdots$ of ideals in $R$ is of finite length. The maximum condition (MC) for ideals holds in $R$ if every nonempty set $S$ of ideals in $R$ contains an ideal not properly contained in any other ideal of the set $S$. The finite basis condition (FBC) for ideals holds in $R$ if for each ideal $N$ in $R$, there is a finite set $B_{N}=\left\{b_{1}, \cdots, b_{n}\right\} \subseteq N$ such that $N$ is the intersection of all ideals of $R$ containing $B_{N}$. The set $B_{N}$ is a finite generating set for $N$.

Show that for every ring $R$, the conditions $\mathrm{ACC}, \mathrm{MC}$, and FBC are equivalent.

33. Let $R$ be any ring. The descending chain condition (DCC) for ideals holds in $R$ if every strictly decreasing sequence $N_{1} \supset N_{2} \supset N_{3} \supset \cdots$ of ideals in $R$ is of finite length. The minimum condition (mC) for ideals holds in $R$ if given any set $S$ of ideals of $R$, there is an ideal of $S$ that does not properly contain any other ideal in the set $S$.

Show that for every ring, the conditions DCC and $\mathrm{mC}$ are equivalent.

34. Give an example of a ring in which ACC holds but DCC does not hold. (See Exercises 32 and 33.)

## Section 46 Euclidean Domains

We have remarked several times on the importance of division algorithms. Our first contact with them was the division algorithm for $\mathbb{Z}$ in Section 6 . This algorithm was immediately used to prove the important theorem that a subgroup of a cyclic group is cyclic, that is, has a single generator. Of course, this shows at once that $\mathbb{Z}$ is a PID. The division algorithm for $F[x]$ appeared in Theorem 23.1 and was used in a completely analogous way to show that $F[x]$ is a PID. Now a modern technique of mathematics is to take some clearly related situations and to try to bring them under one roof by abstracting the important ideas common to them. The following definition is an illustration of this technique, as is this whole text! Let us see what we can develop by starting with the existence of a fairly general division algorithm in an integral domain.

46.1 Definition A Euclidean norm on an integral domain $D$ is a function $v$ mapping the nonzero elements of $D$ into the nonnegative integers such that the following conditions are satisfied:

1. For all $a, b \in D$ with $b \neq 0$, there exist $q$ and $r$ in $D$ such that $a=b q+r$, where either $r=0$ or $v(r)<v(b)$.
2. For all $a, b \in D$, where neither $a$ nor $b$ is $0, v(a) \leq v(a b)$.

An integral domain $D$ is a Euclidean domain if there exists a Euclidean norm on $D$.

The importance of Condition 1 is clear from our discussion. The importance of Condition 2 is that it will enable us to characterize the units of a Euclidean domain $D$.

46.2 Example The integral domain $\mathbb{Z}$ is a Euclidean domain, for the function $v$ defined by $v(n)=|n|$ for $n \neq 0$ in $\mathbb{Z}$ is a Euclidean norm on $\mathbb{Z}$. Condition 1 holds by the division algorithm for $\mathbb{Z}$. Condition 2 follows from $|a b|=|a||b|$ and $|a| \geq 1$ for $a \neq 0$ in $\mathbb{Z}$.

46.3 Example If $F$ is a field, then $F[x]$ is a Euclidean domain, for the function $v$ defined by $v(f(x))=$ (degree $f(x)$ ) for $f(x) \in F[x]$, and $f(x) \neq 0$ is a Euclidean norm. Condition 1 holds by Theorem 23.1, and Condition 2 holds since the degree of the product of two polynomials is the sum of their degrees.

Of course, we should give some examples of Euclidean domains other than these familiar ones that motivated the definition. We shall do this in Section 47. In view of the opening remarks, we anticipate the following theorem.

46.4 Theorem Every Euclidean domain is a PID.

Proof Let $D$ be a Euclidean domain with a Euclidean norm $v$, and let $N$ be an ideal in $D$. If $N=\{0\}$, then $N=\langle 0\rangle$ and $N$ is principal. Suppose that $N \neq\{0\}$. Then there exists $b \neq 0$ in $N$. Let us choose $b$ such that $v(b)$ is minimal among all $\nu(n)$ for $n \in N$. We claim that $N=\langle b\rangle$. Let $a \in N$. Then by Condition 1 for a Euclidean domain, there exist $q$ and $r$ in $D$ such that

$$
a=b q+r
$$

where either $r=0$ or $\nu(r)<v(b)$. Now $r=a-b q$ and $a, b \in N$, so that $r \in N$ since $N$ is an ideal. Thus $v(r)<v(b)$ is impossible by our choice of $b$. Hence $r=0$, so $a=b q$. Since $a$ was any element of $N$, we see that $N=\langle b\rangle$.

46.5 Corollary A Euclidean domain is a UFD.

Proof By Theorem 46.4, a Euclidean domain is a PID and by Theorem 45.17, a PID is a UFD.

Finally, we should mention that while a Euclidean domain is a PID by Theorem 46.4, not every PID is a Euclidean domain. Examples of PIDs that are not Euclidean are not easily found, however.

## Arithmetic in Euclidean Domains

We shall now investigate some properties of Euclidean domains related to their multiplicative structure. We emphasize that the arithmetic structure of a Euclidean domain is not affected in any way by a Euclidean norm $v$ on the domain. A Euclidean norm is merely a useful tool for possibly throwing some light on this arithmetic structure of the domain. The arithmetic structure of a domain $D$ is completely determined by the set $D$ and the two binary operations + and $\cdot$ on $D$.

Let $D$ be a Euclidean domain with a Euclidean norm $v$. We can use Condition 2 of a Euclidean norm to characterize the units of $D$.

46.6 Theorem For a Euclidean domain with a Euclidean norm $v, v(1)$ is minimal among all $v(a)$ for nonzero $a \in D$, and $u \in D$ is a unit if and only if $v(u)=v(1)$.

Proof Condition 2 for $v$ tells us at once that for $a \neq 0$,

$$
v(1) \leq v(1 a)=v(a) .
$$

On the other hand, if $u$ is a unit in $D$, then

$$
\nu(u) \leq v\left(u u^{-1}\right)=v(1) .
$$

Thus

$$
v(u)=v(1)
$$

for a unit $u$ in $D$.

Conversely, suppose that a nonzero $u \in D$ is such that $v(u)=v(1)$. Then by the division algorithm, there exist $q$ and $r$ in $D$ such that

$$
1=u q+r
$$

where either $r=0$ or $v(r)<v(u)$. But since $v(u)=v(1)$ is minimal over all $v(d)$ for nonzero $d \in D, v(r)<v(u)$ is impossible. Hence $r=0$ and $1=u q$, so $u$ is a unit.

46.7 Example

For $\mathbb{Z}$ with $v(n)=|n|$, the minimum of $v(n)$ for nonzero $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ is 1 , and 1 and -1 are the only elements of $\mathbb{Z}$ with $v(n)=1$. Of course, 1 and -1 are exactly the units of $\mathbb{Z}$.

46.8 Example For $F[x]$ with $v(f(x))=($ degree $f(x))$ for $f(x) \neq 0$, the minimum value of $v(f(x))$ for all nonzero $f(x) \in F[x]$ is 0 . The nonzero polynomials of degree 0 are exactly the nonzero elements of $F$, and these are precisely the units of $F[x]$.

We emphasize that everything we prove here holds in every Euclidean domain, in particular in $\mathbb{Z}$ and $F[x]$. As indicated in Example 45.20, we can show that any $a$ and $b$ in a UFD have a gcd and actually compute one by factoring $a$ and $b$ into irreducibles, but such factorizations can be very tough to find. However, if a UFD is actually Euclidean, and we know an easily computed Euclidean norm, there is an easy constructive way to find gcd's, as the next theorem shows.

## Historical Note

$\mathrm{T}^{\mathrm{T}}$

The Euclidean algorithm appears in Euclid's Elements as propositions 1 and 2 of Book VII, where it is used as here to find the greatest common divisor of two integers. Euclid uses it again in Book $\mathrm{X}$ (propositions 2 and 3 ) to find the greatest common measure of two magnitudes (if it exists) and to determine whether two magnitudes are incommensurable.

The algorithm appears again in the Brahmesphutasiddhanta (Correct Astronomical System of Brahma) (628) of the seventh-century Indian mathematician and astronomer Brahmagupta. To solve the indeterminate equation $r x+c=s y$ in integers, Brahmagupta uses Euclid's procedure to "reciprocally divide" $r$ by $s$ until he reaches the final nonzero remainder. By then using, in effect, a substitution procedure based on the various quotients and remainders, he produces a straightforward algorithm for finding the smallest positive solution to his equation.
The thirteenth-century Chinese algebraist Qin Jiushao also used the Euclidean algorithm in his solution of the so-called Chinese Remainder problem published in the Shushu jiuzhang (Mathematical Treatise in Nine Sections) (1247). Qin's goal was to display a method for solving the system of congruences $N \equiv r_{i}\left(\bmod m_{i}\right)$. As part of that method he needed to solve congruences of the form $N x \equiv 1(\bmod m)$, where $N$ and $m$ are relatively prime. The solution to a congruence of this form is again found by a substitution procedure, different from the Indian one, using the quotients and remainders from the Euclidean algorithm applied to $N$ and $m$. It is not known whether the common element in the Indian and Chinese algorithms, the Euclidean algorithm itself, was discovered independently in these cultures or was learned from Greek sources.

46.9 Theorem (Euclidean Algorithm) Let $D$ be a Euclidean domain with a Euclidean norm $v$, and let $a$ and $b$ be nonzero elements of $D$. Let $r_{1}$ be as in Condition 1 for a Euclidean norm, that is,

$$
a=b q_{1}+r_{1}
$$

where either $r_{1}=0$ or $v\left(r_{1}\right)<v(b)$. If $r_{1} \neq 0$, let $r_{2}$ be such that

$$
b=r_{1} q_{2}+r_{2} \text {, }
$$

where either $r_{2}=0$ or $v\left(r_{2}\right)<v\left(r_{1}\right)$. In general, let $r_{i+1}$ be such that

$$
r_{i-1}=r_{i} q_{i+1}+r_{i+1}
$$

where either $r_{i+1}=0$ or $v\left(r_{i+1}\right)<v\left(r_{i}\right)$. Then the sequence $r_{i}, r_{2}, \cdots$ must terminate with some $r_{s}=0$. If $r_{1}=0$, then $b$ is a gcd of $a$ and $b$. If $r_{1} \neq 0$ and $r_{s}$ is the first $r_{i}=0$, then a gcd of $a$ and $b$ is $r_{s-1}$.

Furthermore, if $d$ is a ged of $a$ and $b$, then there exist $\lambda$ and $\mu$ in $D$ such that $d=\lambda a+\mu b$.

Proof Since $v\left(r_{i}\right)<v\left(r_{i-1}\right)$ and $v\left(r_{i}\right)$ is a nonnegative integer, it follows that after some finite number of steps we must arrive at some $r_{s}=0$.

If $r_{1}=0$, then $a=b q_{1}$, and $b$ is a gcd of $a$ and $b$. Suppose $r_{1} \neq 0$. Then if $d \mid a$ and $d \mid b$, we have

$$
d \mid\left(a-b q_{1}\right)
$$

so $d \mid r_{1}$. However, if $d_{1} \mid r_{1}$ and $d_{1} \mid b$, then

$$
d_{1} \mid\left(b q_{1}+r_{1}\right)
$$

so $d_{1} \mid a$. Thus the set of common divisors of $a$ and $b$ is the same set as the set of common divisors of $b$ and $r_{1}$. By a similar argument, if $r_{2} \neq 0$, the set of common divisors of $b$ and $r_{1}$ is the same set as the set of common divisors of $r_{1}$ and $r_{2}$. Continuing this process, we see finally that the set of common divisors of $a$ and $b$ is the same set as the set of common divisors of $r_{s-2}$ and $r_{s-1}$, where $r_{s}$ is the first $r_{i}$ equal to 0 . Thus a ged of $r_{s-2}$ and $r_{s-1}$ is also a ged of $a$ and $b$. But the equation

$$
r_{s-2}=q_{s} r_{s-1}+r_{s}=q_{s} r_{s-1}
$$

shows that a ged of $r_{s-2}$ and $r_{s-1}$ is $r_{s-1}$.

It remains to show that we can express a gcd $d$ of $a$ and $b$ as $d=\lambda a+\mu b$. In terms of the construction just given, if $d=b$, then $d=0 a+1 b$ and we are done. If $d=r_{s-1}$, then, working backward through our equations, we can express each $r_{i}$ in the form $\lambda_{i} r_{i-1}+\mu_{i} r_{i-2}$ for some $\lambda_{i}, \mu_{i} \in D$. To illustrate using the first step, from the equation

$$
r_{s-3}=q_{s-1} r_{s-2}+r_{s-1}
$$

we obtain

$$
d=r_{s-1}=r_{s-3}-q_{s-1} r_{s-2} .
$$

We then express $r_{s-2}$ in terms of $r_{s-3}$ and $r_{s-4}$ and substitute in Eq. (1) to express $d$ in terms of $r_{s-3}$ and $r_{s-4}$. Eventually, we will have

$$
\begin{aligned}
d & =\lambda_{3} r_{2}+\mu_{3} r_{1}=\lambda_{3}\left(b-r_{1} q_{2}\right)+\mu_{3} r_{1}=\lambda_{3} b+\left(\mu_{3}-\lambda_{3} q_{2}\right) r_{1} \\
& =\lambda_{3} b+\left(\mu_{3}-\lambda_{3} q_{2}\right)\left(a-b q_{1}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

which can be expressed in the form $d=\lambda a+\mu b$. If $d^{\prime}$ is any other $\operatorname{gcd}$ of $a$ and $b$, then $d^{\prime}=u d$ for some unit $u$, so $d^{\prime}=(\lambda u) a+(\mu u) b$.

The nice thing about Theorem 46.9 is that it can be implemented on a computer. Of course, we anticipate that of anything that is labeled an "algorithm."

46.10 Example Let us illustrate the Euclidean algorithm for the Euclidean norm || on $\mathbb{Z}$ by computing a gcd of 22,471 and 3,266. We just apply the division algorithm over and over again, and the last nonzero remainder is a gcd. We label the numbers obtained as in Theorem 46.9 to further illustrate the statement and proof of the theorem. The computations are easily checked.

$$
\begin{array}{rlrl} 
& a=22,471 \\
22,471 & =(3,266) 6+2,875 & & r_{1}=2,875 \\
3,266 & =(2,875) 1+391 & & r_{2}=391 \\
2,875 & =(391) 7+138 & & r_{3}=138 \\
391 & =(138) 2+115 & & r_{4}=115 \\
138 & =(115) 1+23 & & r_{5}=23 \\
115 & =(23) 5+0 & & r_{6}=0
\end{array}
$$

Thus $r_{5}=23$ is a gcd of 22,471 and 3,266 . We found a gcd without factoring! This is important, for sometimes it is very difficult to find a factorization of an integer into primes.

46.11 Example Note that the division algorithm Condition 1 in the definition of a Euclidean norm says nothing about $r$ being "positive." In computing a gcd in $\mathbb{Z}$ by the Euclidean algorithm for || , as in Example 46.10, it is surely to our interest to make $\left|r_{i}\right|$ as small as possible in each division. Thus, repeating Example 46.10, it would be more efficient to write

$$
\begin{aligned}
& a=22,471 \\
& b=3,266 \\
& 22,471=(3,266) 7-391 \quad r_{1}=-391 \\
& 3,266=(391) 8+138 \quad r_{2}=138 \\
& 391=(138) 3-23 \quad r_{3}=-23 \\
& 138=(23) 6+0 \quad r_{4}=0
\end{aligned}
$$

We can change the sign of $r_{i}$ from negative to positive when we wish since the divisors of $r_{i}$ and $-r_{i}$ are the same.

## Section 47 Gaussian Integers and Multiplicative Norms

## Gaussian Integers

We should give an example of a Euclidean domain different from $\mathbb{Z}$ and $F[x]$.

47.1 Definition A Gaussian integer is a complex number $a+b i$, where $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$. For a Gaussian integer $\alpha=a+b i$, the norm $N(\alpha)$ of $\alpha$ is $a^{2}+b^{2}$.

We shall let $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ be the set of all Gaussian integers. The following lemma gives some basic properties of the norm function $N$ on $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ and leads to a demonstration that the function $v$ defined by $v(\alpha)=N(\alpha)$ for nonzero $\alpha \in \mathbb{Z}[i]$ is a Euclidean norm on $\mathbb{Z}[i]$. Note that the Gaussian integers include all the rational integers, that is, all the elements of $\mathbb{Z}$.

## Historical Note

Tn his Disquisitiones Arithmeticae, Gauss studied in detail the theory of quadratic residues, that is, the theory of solutions to the congruence $x^{2} \equiv p$ $(\bmod q)$ and proved the famous quadratic reciprocity theorem showing the relationship between the solutions of the congruences $x^{2} \equiv p(\bmod q)$ and $x^{2} \equiv q(\bmod p)$ where $p$ and $q$ are primes. In attempting to generalize his results to theories of quartic residues, however, Gauss realized that it was much more natural to consider the Gaussian integers rather than the ordinary integers.

Gauss's investigations of the Gaussian integers are contained in a long paper published in 1832 in which he proved various analogies between them and the ordinary integers. For example, after noting that there are four units (invertible elements) among the Gaussian integers, namely $1,-1, i$, and $-i$, and defining the norm as in Definition 47.1, he generalized the notion of a prime integer by defining a prime Gaussian integer to be one that cannot be expressed as the product of two other integers, neither of them units. He was then able to determine which Gaussian integers are prime: A Gaussian integer that is not real is prime if and only if its norm is a real prime, which can only be 2 or of the form $4 n+1$. The real prime $2=(1+i)(1-i)$ and real primes congruent to 1 modulo 4 like $13=(2+3 i)(2-3 i)$ factor as the product of two Gaussian primes. Real primes of the form $4 n+3$ like 7 and 11 are still prime in the domain of Gaussian integers. See Exercise 10.

47.2 Lemma In $\mathbb{Z}[i]$, the following properties of the norm function $N$ hold for all $\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{Z}[i]$ :

1. $N(\alpha) \geq 0$.
2. $N(\alpha)=0$ if and only if $\alpha=0$.
3. $N(\alpha \beta)=N(\alpha) N(\beta)$.

Proof If we let $\alpha=a_{1}+a_{2} i$ and $\beta=b_{1}+b_{2} i$, these results are all straightforward computations. We leave the proof of these properties as an exercise (see Exercise 11).

47.3 Lemma $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ is an integral domain.

Proof It is obvious that $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ is a commutative ring with unity. We show that there are no divisors of 0 . Let $\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{Z}[i]$. Using Lemma 47.2, if $\alpha \beta=0$ then

$$
N(\alpha) N(\beta)=N(\alpha \beta)=N(0)=0 .
$$

Thus $\alpha \beta=0$ implies that $N(\alpha)=0$ or $N(\beta)=0$. By Lemma 47.2 again, this implies that either $\alpha=0$ or $\beta=0$. Thus $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ has no divisors of 0 , so $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ is an integral domain.

Of course, since $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ is a subring of $\mathbb{C}$, where $\mathbb{C}$ is the field of complex numbers, it is really obvious that $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ has no 0 divisors. We gave the argument of Lemma 47.3 to
illustrate the use of the multiplicative property 3 of the norm function $N$ and to avoid going outside of $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ in our argument.

47.4 Theorem The function $v$ given by $v(\alpha)=N(\alpha)$ for nonzero $\alpha \in \mathbb{Z}[i]$ is a Euclidean norm on $\mathbb{Z}[i]$. Thus $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ is a Euclidean domain.

Proof Note that for $\beta=b_{1}+b_{2} i \neq 0, N\left(b_{1}+b_{2} i\right)=b_{1}{ }^{2}+b_{2}{ }^{2}$, so $N(\beta) \geq 1$. Then for all $\alpha, \beta \neq 0$ in $\mathbb{Z}[i], N(\alpha) \leq N(\alpha) N(\beta)=N(\alpha \beta)$. This proves Condition 2 for a Euclidean norm in Definition 46.1.

It remains to prove the division algorithm, Condition 1 , for $N$. Let $\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{Z}[i]$, with $\alpha=a_{1}+a_{2} i$ and $\beta=b_{1}+b_{2} i$, where $\beta \neq 0$. We must find $\sigma$ and $\rho$ in $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ such that $\alpha=\beta \sigma+\rho$, where either $\rho=0$ or $N(\rho)<N(\beta)=b_{1}{ }^{2}+b_{2}{ }^{2}$. Let $\alpha / \beta=r+s i$ for $r, s \in \mathbb{Q}$. Let $q_{1}$ and $q_{2}$ be integers in $\mathbb{Z}$ as close as possible to the rational numbers $r$ and $s$, respectively. Let $\sigma=q_{1}+q_{2} i$ and $\rho=\alpha-\beta \sigma$. If $\rho=0$, we are done. Otherwise, by construction of $\sigma$, we see that $\left|r-q_{1}\right| \leq \frac{1}{2}$ and $\left|s-q_{2}\right| \leq \frac{1}{2}$. Therefore

$$
\begin{aligned}
N\left(\frac{\alpha}{\beta}-\sigma\right) & =N\left((r+s i)-\left(q_{1}+q_{2} i\right)\right) \\
& =N\left(\left(r-q_{1}\right)+\left(s-q_{2}\right) i\right) \leq\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{2}+\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{2}=\frac{1}{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus we obtain

$$
N(\rho)=N(\alpha-\beta \sigma)=N\left(\beta\left(\frac{\alpha}{\beta}-\sigma\right)\right)=N(\beta) N\left(\frac{\alpha}{\beta}-\sigma\right) \leq N(\beta) \frac{1}{2}
$$

so we do indeed have $N(\rho)<N(\beta)$ as desired.

47.5 Example We can now apply all our results of Section 46 to $\mathbb{Z}[i]$. In particular, since $N(1)=1$, the units of $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ are exactly the $\alpha=a_{1}+a_{2} i$ with $N(\alpha)=a_{1}{ }^{2}+a_{2}{ }^{2}=1$. From the fact that $a_{1}$ and $a_{2}$ are integers, it follows that the only possibilities are $a_{1}= \pm 1$ with $a_{2}=0$, or $a_{1}=0$ with $a_{2}= \pm 1$. Thus the units of $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ are $\pm 1$ and $\pm i$. One can also use the Euclidean Algorithm to compute a gcd of two nonzero elements. We leave such computations to the exercises. Finally, note that while 5 is an irreducible in $\mathbb{Z}$, 5 is no longer an irreducible in $\mathbb{Z}[i]$, for $5=(1+2 i)(1-2 i)$, and neither $1+2 i$ nor $1-2 i$ is a unit.

## Multiplicative Norms

Let us point out again that for an integral domain $D$, the arithmetic concepts of irreducibles and units are not affected in any way by a norm that may be defined on the domain. However, as the preceding section and our work thus far in this section show, a suitably defined norm may be of help in determining the arithmetic structure of $D$. This is strikingly illustrated in algebraic number theory, where for a domain of algebraic integers we consider many different norms of the domain, each doing its part in helping to determine the arithmetic structure of the domain. In a domain of algebraic integers, we have essentially one norm for each irreducible (up to associates), and each such norm gives information concerning the behavior in the integral domain of the irreducible to
which it corresponds. This is an example of the importance of studying properties of elements in an algebraic structure by means of mappings associated with them.

Let us study integral domains that have a multiplicative norm satisfying Properties 2 and 3 of $N$ on $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ given in Lemma 47.2.

47.6 Definition Let $D$ be an integral domain. A multiplicative norm $N$ on $D$ is a function mapping $D$ into the integers $\mathbb{Z}$ such that the following conditions are satisfied:

1. $N(\alpha)=0$ if and only if $\alpha=0$.
2. $N(\alpha \beta)=N(\alpha) N(\beta)$ for all $\alpha, \beta \in D$.

47.7 Theorem If $D$ is an integral domain with a multiplicative norm $N$, then $N(1)=1$ and $|N(u)|=1$ for every unit $u$ in $D$. If, furthermore, every $\alpha$ such that $|N(\alpha)|=1$ is a unit in $D$, then an element $\pi$ in $D$, with $|N(\pi)|=p$ for a prime $p \in \mathbb{Z}$, is an irreducible of $D$.

Proof Let $D$ be an integral domain with a multiplicative norm $N$. Then

$$
N(1)=N((1)(1))=N(1) N(1)
$$

shows that $N(1)=1$. Also, if $u$ is a unit in $D$, then

$$
1=N(1)=N\left(u u^{-1}\right)=N(u) N\left(u^{-1}\right) .
$$

Since $N(u)$ is an integer, this implies that $|N(u)|=1$.

Now suppose that the units of $D$ are exactly the elements of norm $\pm 1$. Let $\pi \in D$ be such that $|N(\pi)|=p$, where $p$ is a prime in $\mathbb{Z}$. Then if $\pi=\alpha \beta$, we have

$$
p=|N(\pi)|=|N(\alpha) N(\beta)|,
$$

so either $|N(\alpha)|=1$ or $|N(\beta)|=1$. By assumption, this means that either $\alpha$ or $\beta$ is a unit of $D$. Thus $\pi$ is an irreducible of $D$.

47.8 Example $\quad$ On $\mathbb{Z}[i]$, the function $N$ defined by $N(a+b i)=a^{2}+b^{2}$ gives a multiplicative norm in the sense of our definition. We saw that the function $v$ given by $v(\alpha)=N(\alpha)$ for nonzero $\alpha \in \mathbb{Z}[i]$ is a Euclidean norm on $\mathbb{Z}[i]$, so the units are precisely the elements $\alpha$ of $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ with $N(\alpha)=N(1)=1$. Thus the second part of Theorem 47.7 applies in $\mathbb{Z}[i]$. We saw in Example 47.5 that 5 is not an irreducible in $\mathbb{Z}[i]$, for $5=(1+2 i)(1-2 i)$. Since $N(1+2 i)=N(1-2 i)=1^{2}+2^{2}=5$ and 5 is a prime in $\mathbb{Z}$, we see from Theorem 47.7 that $1+2 i$ and $1-2 i$ are both irreducibles in $\mathbb{Z}[i]$.

As an application of mutiplicative norms, we shall now give another example of an integral domain that is not a UFD. We saw one example in Example 45.16. The following is the standard illustration.

47.9 Example $\quad$ Let $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]=\{a+i b \sqrt{5} \mid a, b \in \mathbb{Z}\}$. As a subset of the complex numbers closed under addition, subtraction, and multiplication, and containing 0 and $1, \mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$ is an integral domain. Define $N$ on $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$ by

$$
N(a+b \sqrt{-5})=a^{2}+5 b^{2} .
$$

(Here $\sqrt{-5}=i \sqrt{5}$.) Clearly, $N(\alpha)=0$ if and only if $\alpha=a+b \sqrt{-5}=0$. That $N(\alpha \beta)=N(\alpha) N(\beta)$ is a straightforward computation that we leave to the exercises (see Exercise 12). Let us find all candidates for units in $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$ by finding all elements $\alpha$ in $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$ with $N(\alpha)=1$. If $\alpha=a+b \sqrt{-5}$, and $N(\alpha)=1$, we must have $a^{2}+5 b^{2}=1$ for integers $a$ and $b$. This is only possible if $b=0$ and $a= \pm 1$. Hence $\pm 1$ are the only candidates for units. Since $\pm 1$ are units, they are then precisely the units in $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$.

Now in $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$, we have $21=(3)(7)$ and also

$$
21=(1+2 \sqrt{-5})(1-2 \sqrt{-5}) .
$$

If we can show that $3,7,1+2 \sqrt{-5}$, and $1-2 \sqrt{-5}$ are all irreducibles in $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$, we will then know that $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$ cannot be a UFD, since neither 3 nor 7 is $\pm(1+2 \sqrt{-5})$.

Suppose that $3=\alpha \beta$. Then

$$
9=N(3)=N(\alpha) N(\beta)
$$

shows that we must have $N(\alpha)=1,3$, or 9 . If $N(\alpha)=1$, then $\alpha$ is a unit. If $\alpha=$ $a+b \sqrt{-5}$, then $N(\alpha)=a^{2}+5 b^{2}$, and for no choice of integers $a$ and $b$ is $N(\alpha)=3$. If $N(\alpha)=9$, then $N(\beta)=1$, so $\beta$ is a unit. Thus from $3=\alpha \beta$, we can conclude that either $\alpha$ or $\beta$ is a unit. Therefore, 3 is an irreducible in $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$. A similar argument shows that 7 is also an irreducible in $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$.

If $1+2 \sqrt{-5}=\gamma \delta$, we have

$$
21=N(1+2 \sqrt{-5})=N(\gamma) N(\delta) .
$$

so $N(\gamma)=1,3,7$, or 21 . We have seen that there is no element of $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$ of norm 3 or 7. This either $N(\gamma)=1$, and $\gamma$ is a unit, or $N(\gamma)=21$, so $N(\delta)=1$, and $\delta$ is a unit. Therefore, $1+2 \sqrt{-5}$ is an irreducible in $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$. A parallel argument shows that $1-2 \sqrt{-5}$ is also an irreducible in $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$.

In summary, we have shown that

$$
\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]=\{a+i b \sqrt{5} \mid a, b \in \mathbb{Z}\}
$$

is an integral domain but not a UFD. In particular, there are two different factorizations

$$
21=3 \cdot 7=(1+2 \sqrt{-5})(1-2 \sqrt{-5})
$$

of 21 into irreducibles. These irreducibles cannot be primes, for the property of a prime enables us to prove uniqueness of factorization (see the proof of Theorem 45.17).

We conclude with a classical application, determining which primes $p$ in $\mathbb{Z}$ are equal to a sum of squares of two integers in $\mathbb{Z}$. For example, $2=1^{2}+1^{2}, 5=1^{2}+2^{2}$, and $13=2^{2}+3^{2}$ are sums of squares. Since we have now answered this question for the only even prime number, 2 , we can restrict ourselves to odd primes.

47.10 Theorem (Fermat's $\boldsymbol{p}=\boldsymbol{a}^{\mathbf{2}}+\boldsymbol{b}^{\mathbf{2}}$ Theorem) Let $p$ be an odd prime in $\mathbb{Z}$. Then $p=a^{2}+b^{2}$ for integers $a$ and $b$ in $\mathbb{Z}$ if and only if $p \equiv 1(\bmod 4)$.

Proof First, suppose that $p=a^{2}+b^{2}$. Now $a$ and $b$ cannot both be even or both be odd since $p$ is an odd number. If $a=2 r$ and $b=2 s+1$, then $a^{2}+b^{2}=4 r^{2}+4\left(s^{2}+s\right)+1$, so $p \equiv 1(\bmod 4)$. This takes care of one direction for this "if and only if" theorem.

For the other direction, we assume that $p \equiv 1(\bmod 4)$. Now the multiplicative group of nonzero elements of the finite field $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ is cyclic, and has order $p-1$. Since 4 is a divisor of $p-1$, we see that $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ contains an element $n$ of multiplicative order 4 . It follows that $n^{2}$ has multiplicative order 2 , so $n^{2}=-1$ in $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$. Thus in $\mathbb{Z}$, we have $n^{2} \equiv-1(\bmod$ $p$ ), so $p$ divides $n^{2}+1$ in $\mathbb{Z}$.

Viewing $p$ and $n^{2}+1$ in $\mathbb{Z}[i]$, we see that $p$ divides $n^{2}+1=(n+i)(n-i)$. Suppose that $p$ is irreducible in $\mathbb{Z}[i]$; then $p$ would have to divide $n+i$ or $n-i$. If $p$ divides $n+i$, then $n+i=p(a+b i)$ for some $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$. Equating coefficients of $i$, we obtain $1=p b$, which is impossible. Similarly, $p$ divides $n-i$ would lead to an impossible equation $-1=p b$. Thus our assumption that $p$ is irreducible in $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ must be false.

Since $p$ is not irreducible in $\mathbb{Z}[i]$, we have $p=(a+b i)(c+d i)$ where neither $a+$ $b i$ nor $c+d i$ is a unit. Taking norms, we have $p^{2}=\left(a^{2}+b^{2}\right)\left(c^{2}+d^{2}\right)$ where neither $a^{2}+b^{2}=1$ nor $c^{2}+d^{2}=1$. Consequently, we have $p=a^{2}+b^{2}$, which completes our proof. [Since $a^{2}+b^{2}=(a+b i)(a-b i)$, we see that this is the factorization of $p$, that is, $c+d i=a-b i$.]

Exercise 10 asks you to determine which primes $p$ in $\mathbb{Z}$ remain irreducible in $\mathbb{Z}[i]$.

## SECTION 48 AUTOMORPHISMS OF FIELDS

## The Conjugation Isomorphisms of Algebraic Field Theory

Let $F$ be a field, and let $\bar{F}$ be an algebraic closure of $F$, that is, an algebraic extension of $F$ that is algebraically closed. Such a field $\bar{F}$ exists, by Theorem 31.17. Our selection of a particular $\bar{F}$ is not critical, since, as we shall show in Section 49 , any two algebraic closures of $F$ are isomorphic under a map leaving $F$ fixed. From now on in our work, we shall assume that all algebraic extensions and all elements algebraic over a field $F$ under consideration are contained in one fixed algebraic closure $\bar{F}$ of $F$.

Remember that we are engaged in the study of zeros of polynomials. In the terminology of Section 31, studying zeros of polynomials in $F[x]$ amounts to studying the structure of algebraic extensions of $F$ and of elements algebraic over $F$. We shall show that if $E$ is an algebraic extension of $F$ with $\alpha, \beta \in E$, then $\alpha$ and $\beta$ have the same algebraic properties if and only if $\operatorname{irr}(\alpha, F)=\operatorname{irr}(\beta, F)$. We shall phrase this fact in terms of mappings, as we have been doing all along in field theory. We achieve this by showing that if $\operatorname{irr}(\alpha, F)=\operatorname{irr}(\beta, F)$, then there exists an isomorphism $\psi_{\alpha, \beta}$ of $F(\alpha)$ onto $F(\beta)$ that maps each element of $F$ onto itself and maps $\alpha$ onto $\beta$. The next theorem exhibits this isomorphism $\psi_{\alpha, \beta}$. These isomorphisms will become our fundamental tools for the study of algebraic extensions; they supplant the evaluation homomorphisms $\phi_{\alpha}$ of Theorem 22.4, which make their last contribution in defining these isomorphisms. Before stating and proving this theorem, let us introduce some more terminology.[^19]

48.1 Definition Let $E$ be an algebraic extension of a field $F$. Two elements $\alpha, \beta \in E$ are conjugate over $F$ if $\operatorname{irr}(\alpha, F)=\operatorname{irr}(\beta, F)$, that is, if $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are zeros of the same irreducible polynomial over $F$.

48.2 Example The concept of conjugate elements just defined conforms with the classic idea of conjugate complex numbers if we understand that by conjugate complex numbers we mean numbers that are conjugate over $\mathbb{R}$. If $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ and $b \neq 0$, the conjugate complex numbers $a+b i$ and $a-b i$ are both zeros of $x^{2}-2 a x+a^{2}+b^{2}$, which is irreducible in $\mathbb{R}[x]$.

48.3 Theorem (The Conjugation Isomorphisms) Let $F$ be a field, and let $\alpha$ and $\beta$ be algebraic over $F$ with $\operatorname{deg}(\alpha, F)=n$. The map $\psi_{\alpha, \beta}: F(\alpha) \rightarrow F(\beta)$ defined by

$$
\psi_{\alpha, \beta}\left(c_{0}+c_{i} \alpha+\cdots+c_{n-1} \alpha^{n-1}\right)=c_{0}+c_{1} \beta+\cdots+c_{n-1} \beta^{n-1}
$$

for $c_{i} \in F$ is an isomorphism of $F(\alpha)$ onto $F(\beta)$ if and only if $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are conjugate over $F$.

Proof Suppose that $\psi_{\alpha, \beta}: F(\alpha) \rightarrow F(\beta)$ as defined in the statement of the theorem is an isomorphism. Let $\operatorname{irr}(\alpha, F)=a_{0}+a_{1} x+\cdots+a_{n} x^{n}$. Then $a_{0}+a_{1} \alpha+\cdots+a_{n} \alpha^{n}=0$, so

$$
\psi_{\alpha, \beta}\left(a_{0}+a_{1} \alpha+\cdots+a_{n} \alpha^{n}\right)=a_{0}+a_{1} \beta+\cdots+a_{n} \beta^{n}=0 .
$$

By the last assertion in the statement of Theorem 29.13 this implies that $\operatorname{irr}(\beta, F)$ divides $\operatorname{irr}(\alpha, F)$. A similar argument using the isomorphism $\left(\psi_{\alpha, \beta}\right)^{-1}=\psi_{\beta, \alpha}$ shows that $\operatorname{irr}(\alpha, F)$ divides $\operatorname{irr}(\beta, F)$. Therefore, since both polynomials are monic, $\operatorname{irr}(\alpha, F)=$ $\operatorname{irr}(\beta, F)$, so $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are conjugate over $F$.

Conversely, suppose $\operatorname{irr}(\alpha, F)=\operatorname{irr}(\beta, F)=p(x)$. Then the evaluation homomorphisms $\phi_{\alpha}: F[x] \rightarrow F(\alpha)$ and $\phi_{\beta}: F[x] \rightarrow F(\beta)$ both have the same kernel $\langle p(x)\rangle$. By Theorem 26.17, corresponding to $\phi_{\alpha}: F[x] \rightarrow F(\alpha)$, there is a natural isomorphism $\psi_{\alpha}$ mapping $F[x] /\langle p(x)\rangle$ onto $\phi_{\alpha}[F[x]]=F(\alpha)$. Similarly, $\phi_{\beta}$ gives rise to an isomorphism $\psi_{\beta}$ mapping $F[x] /\langle p(x)\rangle$ onto $F(\beta)$. Let $\psi_{\alpha, \beta}=\psi_{\beta}\left(\psi_{\alpha}\right)^{-1}$. These mappings are diagrammed in Fig. 48.4 where the dashed lines indicate corresponding elements under the mappings. As the composition of two isomorphisms, $\psi_{\alpha, \beta}$ is again an isomorphism and maps $F(\alpha)$ onto $F(\beta)$. For $\left(c_{0}+c_{1} \alpha+\cdots+c_{n-1} \alpha^{n-1}\right) \in F(\alpha)$, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \psi_{\alpha, \beta}\left(c_{0}+c_{1} \alpha+\cdots+c_{n-1} \alpha^{n-1}\right) \\
& \quad=\left(\psi_{\beta} \psi_{\alpha}{ }^{-1}\right)\left(c_{0}+c_{1} \alpha+\cdots+c_{n-1} \alpha^{n-1}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

& =c_{0}+c_{1} \beta+\cdots+c_{n-1} \beta^{n-1}
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus $\psi_{\alpha, \beta}$ is the map defined in the statement of the theorem.

The following corollary of Theorem 48.3 is the cornerstone of our proof of the important Isomorphism Extension Theorem of Section 49 and of most of the rest of our work.

48.5 Corollary Let $\alpha$ be algebraic over a field $F$. Every isomorphism $\psi$ mapping $F(\alpha)$ onto a subfield of $\bar{F}$ such that $\psi(a)=a$ for $a \in F$ maps $\alpha$ onto a conjugate $\beta$ of $\alpha$ over $F$. Conversely, for each conjugate $\beta$ of $\alpha$ over $F$, there exists exactly one isomorphism $\psi_{\alpha, \beta}$ of $F(\alpha)$ onto a subfield of $\bar{F}$ mapping $\alpha$ onto $\beta$ and mapping each $a \in F$ onto itself.

Proof Let $\psi$ be an isomorphism of $F(\alpha)$ onto a subfield of $\bar{F}$ such that $\psi(a)=a$ for $a \in F$. Let $\operatorname{irr}(\alpha, F)=a_{0}+a_{1} x+\cdots+a_{n} x^{n}$. Then

$$
a_{0}+a_{1} \alpha+\cdots+a_{n} \alpha^{n}=0
$$

so

$$
0=\psi\left(a_{0}+a_{1} \alpha+\cdots+a_{n} \alpha^{n}\right)=a_{0}+a_{1} \psi(\alpha)+\cdots+a_{n} \psi(\alpha)^{n},
$$

and $\beta=\psi(\alpha)$ is a conjugate of $\alpha$.

Conversely, for each conjugate $\beta$ of $\alpha$ over $F$, the conjugation isomorphism $\psi_{\alpha, \beta}$ of Theorem 48.3 is an isomorphism with the desired properties. That $\psi_{\alpha, \beta}$ is the only such isomorphism follows from the fact that an isomorphism of $F(\alpha)$ is completely determined by its values on elements of $F$ and its value on $\alpha$.

As a second corollary of Theorem 48.3, we can prove a familiar result.

48.6 Corollary Let $f(x) \in \mathbb{R}[x]$. If $f(a+b i)=0$ for $(a+b i) \in \mathbb{C}$, where $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$, then $f(a-b i)=$ 0 also. Loosely, complex zeros of polynomials with real coefficients occur in conjugate pairs.

Proof We have seen that $\mathbb{C}=\mathbb{R}(i)$. Now

$$
\operatorname{irr}(i, \mathbb{R})=\operatorname{irr}(-i, \mathbb{R})=x^{2}+1
$$

so $i$ and $-i$ are conjugate over $\mathbb{R}$. By Theorem 48.3, the conjugation map $\psi_{i,-i}: \mathbb{C} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ where $\psi_{i,-i}(a+b i)=a-b i$ is an isomorphism. Thus, if for $a_{i} \in \mathbb{R}$,

$$
f(a+b i)=a_{0}+a_{1}(a+b i)+\cdots+a_{n}(a+b i)^{n}=0,
$$

then

$$
\begin{aligned}
0=\psi_{i,-i}(f(a+b i)) & =a_{0}+a_{1}(a-b i)+\cdots+a_{n}(a-b i)^{n} \\
& =f(a-b i)
\end{aligned}
$$

that is, $f(a-b i)=0$ also.

48.7 Example $\quad$ Consider $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})$ over $\mathbb{Q}$. The zeros of $\operatorname{irr}(\sqrt{2}, \mathbb{Q})=x^{2}-2$ are $\sqrt{2}$, and $-\sqrt{2}$, so $\sqrt{2}$ and $-\sqrt{2}$ are conjugate over $\mathbb{Q}$. According to Theorem 48.3 the map $\psi_{\sqrt{2},-\sqrt{2}}: \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}) \rightarrow$ $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})$ defined by

$$
\psi_{\sqrt{2},-\sqrt{2}}(a+b \sqrt{2})=a-b \sqrt{2}
$$

is an isomorphism of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})$ onto itself.

## Automorphisms and Fixed Fields

As illustrated in the preceding corollary and example, a field may have a nontrivial isomorphism onto itself. Such maps will be of utmost importance in the work that follows.

48.8 Definition An isomorphism of a field onto itself is an automorphism of the field.

48.9 Definition If $\sigma$ is an isomorphism of a field $E$ onto some field, then an element $a$ of $E$ is left fixed by $\sigma$ if $\sigma(a)=a$. A collection $S$ of isomorphisms of $E$ leaves a subfield $F$ of $E$ fixed if each $a \in F$ is left fixed by every $\sigma \in S$. If $\{\sigma\}$ leaves $F$ fixed, then $\sigma$ leaves $F$ fixed.

48.10 Example $\quad$ Let $E=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3})$. The map $\sigma: E \rightarrow E$ defined by

$$
\sigma(a+b \sqrt{2}+c \sqrt{3}+d \sqrt{6})=a+b \sqrt{2}-c \sqrt{3}-d \sqrt{6}
$$

for $a, b, c, d \in \mathbb{Q}$ is an automorphism of $E$; it is the conjugation isomorphism $\psi_{\sqrt{3}},-\sqrt{3}$ of $E$ onto itself if we view $E$ as $(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})(\sqrt{3})$. We see that $\sigma$ leaves $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})$ fixed.

It is our purpose to study the structure of an algebraic extension $E$ of a field $F$ by studying the automorphisms of $E$ that leave fixed each element of $F$. We shall presently show that these automorphisms form a group in a natural way. We can then apply the results concerning group structure to get information about the structure of our field extension. Thus much of our preceding work is now being brought together. The next three theorems are readily proved, but the ideas contained in them form the foundation for everything that follows. These theorems are therefore of great importance to us. They really amount to observations, rather than theorems; it is the ideas contained in them that are important. A big step in mathematics does not always consist of proving a hard theorem, but may consist of noticing how certain known mathematics may relate to new situations. Here we are bringing group theory into our study of zeros of polynomials. Be sure to understand the concepts involved. Unlikely as it may seem, they are the key to the solution of our final goal in this text.

Final Goal (to be more precisely stated later): To show that not all zeros of every quintic (degree 5) polynomial $f(x)$ can be expressed in terms of radicals starting with elements in the field containing the coefficients of $f(x)$.

## Historical Note

Tt was Richard Dedekind who first developed the idea of an automorphism of a field, what he called a "permutation of the field," in 1894. The earlier application of group theory to the theory of equations had been through groups of permutations of the roots of certain polynomials. Dedekind extended this idea to mappings of the entire field and proved several of the theorems of this section.

Though Heinrich Weber continued Dedekind's approach to groups acting on fields in his algebra text of 1895 , this method was not pursued in other texts near the turn of the century. It was not until the 1920s, after Emmy Noether's abstract approach to algebra became influential at Göttingen, that Emil Artin (1898-1962) developed this relationship of groups and fields in great detail. Artin emphasized that the goal of what is now called Galois theory should not be to determine solvability conditions for algebraic equations, but to explore the relationship between field extensions and groups of automorphisms. Artin detailed his approach in a lecture given in 1926; his method was first published in B. L. Van der Waerden's Modern Algebra text of 1930 and later by Artin himself in lecture notes in 1938 and 1942. In fact, the remainder of this text is based on Artin's development of Galois theory.

If $\left\{\sigma_{i} \mid i \in I\right\}$ is a collection of automorphisms of a field $E$, the elements of $E$ about which $\left\{\sigma_{i} \mid i \in I\right\}$ gives the least information are those $a \in E$ left fixed by every $\sigma_{i}$ for $i \in I$. This first of our three theorems contains almost all that can be said about these fixed elements of $E$.

48.11 Theorem Let $\left\{\sigma_{i} \mid i \in I\right\}$ be a collection of automorphisms of a field $E$. Then the set $E_{\left\{\sigma_{i}\right\}}$ of all $a \in E$ left fixed by every $\sigma_{i}$ for $i \in I$ forms a subfield of $E$.

Proof If $\sigma_{i}(a)=a$ and $\sigma_{i}(b)=b$ for all $i \in I$, then

$$
\sigma_{i}(a \pm b)=\sigma_{i}(a) \pm \sigma_{i}(b)=a \pm b
$$

and

$$
\sigma_{i}(a b)=\sigma_{i}(a) \sigma_{i}(b)=a b
$$

for all $i \in I$. Also, if $b \neq 0$, then

$$
\sigma_{i}(a / b)=\sigma_{i}(a) / \sigma_{i}(b)=a / b
$$

for all $i \in I$. Since the $\sigma_{i}$ are automorphisms, we have

$$
\sigma_{i}(0)=0 \quad \text { and } \quad \sigma_{i}(1)=1
$$

for all $i \in I$. Hence $0,1 \in E_{\left\{\sigma_{i}\right\}}$ Thus $E_{\left\{\sigma_{i}\right\}}$ is a subfield of $E$.

48.12 Definition The field $E_{\left\{\sigma_{i}\right\}}$ of Theorem 48.11 is the fixed field of $\left\{\sigma_{i} \mid i \in I\right\}$. For a single automorphism $\sigma$, we shall refer to $E_{\{\sigma\}}$ as the fixed field of $\sigma$.

48.13 Example Consider the automorphism $\psi_{\sqrt{2},-\sqrt{2}}$ of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})$ given in Example 48.7. For $a, b \in \mathbb{Q}$, we have

$$
\psi_{\sqrt{2},-\sqrt{2}}(a+b \sqrt{2})=a-b \sqrt{2}
$$

and $a-b \sqrt{2}=a+b \sqrt{2}$ if and only if $b=0$. Thus the fixed field of $\psi_{\sqrt{2},-\sqrt{2}}$ is $\mathbb{Q}$.

Note that an automorphism of a field $E$ is in particular a one-to-one mapping of $E$ onto $E$, that is, a permutation of $E$. If $\sigma$ and $\tau$ are automorphisms of $E$, then the permutation $\sigma \tau$ is again an automorphism of $E$, since, in general, composition of homomorphisms again yields a homomorphism. This is how group theory makes its entrance.

48.14 Theorem The set of all automorphisms of a field $E$ is a group under function composition.

Proof Multiplication of automorphisms of $E$ is defined by function composition, and is thus associative (it is permutation multiplication). The identity permutation $\iota: E \rightarrow E$ given by $\iota(\alpha)=\alpha$ for $\alpha \in E$ is an automorphism of $E$. If $\sigma$ is an automorphism, then the permutation $\sigma^{-1}$ is also an automorphism. Thus all automorphisms of $E$ form a subgroup of $S_{E}$, the group of all permutations of $E$ given by Theorem 8.5.

48.15 Theorem Let $E$ be a field, and let $F$ be a subfield of $E$. Then the set $G(E / F)$ of all automorphisms of $E$ leaving $F$ fixed forms a subgroup of the group of all automorphisms of $E$. Furthermore, $F \leq E_{G(E / F)}$.

Proof For $\sigma, \tau \in G(E / F)$ and $a \in F$, we have

$$
(\sigma \tau)(a)=\sigma(\tau(a))=\sigma(a)=a
$$

so $\sigma \tau \in G(E / F)$. Of course, the identity automorphism $\iota$ is in $G(E / F)$. Also, if $\sigma(a)=a$ for $a \in F$, then $a=\sigma^{-1}(a)$ so $\sigma \in G(E / F)$ implies that $\sigma^{-1} \in G(E / F)$. Thus $G(E / F)$ is a subgroup of the group of all automorphisms of $E$.

Since every element of $F$ is left fixed by every element of $G(E / F)$, it follows immediately that the field $E_{G(E / F)}$ of all elements of $E$ left fixed by $G(E / F)$ contains $F$.

48.16 Definition The group $G(E / F)$ of the preceding theorem is the group of automorphisms of $E$ leaving $F$ fixed, or, more briefly, the group of $E$ over $F$.

Do not think of $E / F$ in the notation $G(E / F)$ as denoting a quotient space of some sort, but rather as meaning that $E$ is an extension field of the field $F$.

The ideas contained in the preceding three theorems are illustrated in the following example. We urge you to study this example carefully.

48.17 Example Consider the field $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3})$. Example 31.9 shows that $[\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}): \mathbb{Q}]=4$. If we view $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3})$ as $(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3}))(\sqrt{2})$, the conjugation isomorphism $\psi_{\sqrt{2},-\sqrt{2}}$ of Theorem 48.3 defined by

$$
\psi_{\sqrt{2},-\sqrt{2}}(a+b \sqrt{2})=a-b \sqrt{2}
$$

for $a, b \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3})$ is an automorphism of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3})$ having $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3})$ as fixed field. Similarly, we have the automorphism $\psi_{\sqrt{3}},-\sqrt{3}$ of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3})$ having $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})$ as fixed field. Since the product of two automorphisms is an automorphism, we can consider $\psi_{\sqrt{2},-\sqrt{2}} \psi_{\sqrt{3},-\sqrt{3}}$ which moves both $\sqrt{2}$ and $\sqrt{3}$, that is, leaves neither number fixed. Let

$$
\iota=\text { the identity automorphism }
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \sigma_{1}=\psi_{\sqrt{2},-\sqrt{2}} \\
& \sigma_{2}=\psi_{\sqrt{3},-\sqrt{3}}, \text { and } \\
& \sigma_{3}=\psi_{\sqrt{2},-\sqrt{2}} \psi_{\sqrt{3},-\sqrt{3}}
\end{aligned}
$$

### 48.18 Table

|  | $\iota$ | $\sigma_{1}$ | $\sigma_{2}$ | $\sigma_{3}$ |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| $\iota$ | $\iota$ | $\sigma_{1}$ | $\sigma_{2}$ | $\sigma_{3}$ |

The group of all automorphisms of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3})$ has a fixed field, by Theorem 48.11. This fixed field must contain $\mathbb{Q}$, since every automorphism of a field leaves 1 and hence the prime subfield fixed. A basis for $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3})$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ is $\{1, \sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}, \sqrt{6}\}$. Since $\sigma_{1}(\sqrt{2})=-\sqrt{2}, \sigma_{1}(\sqrt{6})=-\sqrt{6}$ and $\sigma_{2}(\sqrt{3})=-\sqrt{3}$, we see that $\mathbb{Q}$ is exactly the fixed field of $\left\{\iota, \sigma_{1}, \sigma_{2}, \sigma_{3}\right\}$. It is readily checked that $G=\left\{\iota, \sigma_{1}, \sigma_{2}, \sigma_{3}\right\}$ is a group under automorphism multiplication (function composition). The group table for $G$ is given in Table 48.18. For example,

$$
\sigma_{1} \sigma_{3}=\psi_{\sqrt{2},-\sqrt{2}}\left(\psi_{\sqrt{2},-\sqrt{2}} \psi_{\sqrt{3},-\sqrt{3}}\right)=\psi_{\sqrt{3},-\sqrt{3}}=\sigma_{2} .
$$

The group $G$ is isomorphic to the Klein 4-group. We can show that $G$ is the full group $\mathbb{G}(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}) / \mathbb{Q})$, because every automorphism $\tau$ of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3})$ maps $\sqrt{2}$ onto either $\pm \sqrt{2}$, by Corollary 48.5. Similarly, $\tau$ maps $\sqrt{3}$ onto either $\pm \sqrt{3}$. But since $\{1, \sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}, \sqrt{2} \sqrt{3}\}$ is a basis for $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3})$ over $\mathbb{Q}$, an automorphism of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3})$ leaving $\mathbb{Q}$ fixed is determined by its values on $\sqrt{2}$ and $\sqrt{3}$. Now, $\iota, \sigma_{1}, \sigma_{2}$, and $\sigma_{3}$ give all possible combinations of values on $\sqrt{2}$ and $\sqrt{3}$, and hence are all possible automorphisms of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3})$.

Note that $G(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}) / \mathbb{Q})$ has order 4 , and $[\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}): \mathbb{Q}]=4$. This is no accident, but rather an instance of a general situation, as we shall see later.

## The Frobenius Automorphism

Let $F$ be a finite field. We shall show later that the group of all automorphisms of $F$ is cyclic. Now a cyclic group has by definition a generating element, and it may have several generating elements. For an abstract cyclic group there is no way of distinguishing any one generator as being more important than any other. However, for the cyclic group of all automorphisms of a finite field there is a canonical (natural) generator, the Frobenius automorphism (classically, the Frobenius substitution). This fact is of considerable importance in some advanced work in algebra. The next theorem exhibits this Frobenius automorphism.

48.19 Theorem Let $F$ be a finite field of characteristic $p$. Then the map $\sigma_{p}: F \rightarrow F$ defined by $\sigma_{p}(a)=$ $a^{p}$ for $a \in F$ is an automorphism, the Frobenius automorphism, of $F$. Also, $F_{\left\{\sigma_{p}\right\}} \simeq \mathbb{Z}_{p}$.

Proof Let $a, b \in F$. Taking $n=1$ in Lemma 33.9, we see that $(a+b)^{p}=a^{p}+b^{p}$. Thus we have

$$
\sigma_{p}(a+b)=(a+b)^{p}=a^{p}+b^{p}=\sigma_{p}(a)+\sigma_{p}(b)
$$

Of course,

$$
\sigma_{p}(a b)=(a b)^{p}=a^{p} b^{p}=\sigma_{p}(a) \sigma_{p}(b),
$$

so $\sigma_{p}$ is at least a homomorphism. If $\sigma_{p}(a)=0$, then $a^{p}=0$, and $a=0$, so the kernel of $\sigma_{p}$ is $\{0\}$, and $\sigma_{p}$ is a one-to-one map. Finally, since $F$ is finite, $\sigma_{p}$ is onto, by counting. Thus $\sigma_{p}$ is an automorphism of $F$.

The prime field $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ must be contained (up to isomorphism) in $F$, since $F$ is of characteristic $p$. For $c \in \mathrm{Z}_{p}$, we have $\sigma_{p}(c)=c^{p}=c$, by Fermat's theorem (see Corollary 20.2). Thus the polynomial $x^{p}-x$ has $p$ zeros in $F$, namely the elements of $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$. By Corollary 23.5, a polynomial of degree $n$ over a field can have at most $n$ zeros in the field. Since the elements fixed under $\sigma_{p}$ are precisely the zeros in $F$ of $x^{p}-x$, we see that

$$
\mathbb{Z}_{p}=F_{\left\{\sigma_{p}\right\}}
$$

Freshmen in college still sometimes make the error of saying that $(a+b)^{n}=$ $a^{n}+b^{n}$. Here we see that this freshman exponentiation, $(a+b)^{p}=a^{p}+b^{p}$ with exponent $p$, is actually valid in a field $F$ of characteristic $p$.

$$

## SECTION 49 The ISOMORPHISM EXTENSION THEOREM

## The Extension Theorem

Let us continue studying automorphisms of fields. In this section and the next, we shall be concerned with both the existence and the number of automorphisms of a field $E$.

Suppose that $E$ is an algebraic extension of $F$ and that we want to find some automorphisms of $E$. We know from Theorem 48.3 that if $\alpha, \beta \in E$ are conjugate over $F$, then there is an isomorphism $\psi_{\alpha, \beta}$ of $F(\alpha)$ onto $F(\beta)$. Of course, $\alpha, \beta \in E$ implies both $F(\alpha) \leq E$ and $F(\beta) \leq E$. It is natural to wonder whether the domain of definition of $\psi_{\alpha, \beta}$ can be enlarged from $F(\alpha)$ to a larger field, perhaps all of $E$, and whether this might perhaps lead to an automorphism of $E$. A mapping diagram of this situation is shown in Fig. 49.1. Rather than speak of "enlarging the domain of definition of $\psi_{\alpha, \beta}$," it

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_01_27_9289ad7bed1dd2e5e553g-396.jpg?height=371&width=436&top_left_y=454&top_left_x=801)

49.2 Figure

is customary to speak of "extending the map $\psi_{\alpha, \beta}$ to a map $\tau$," which is a mapping of all of $E$.

Remember that we are always assuming that all algebraic extension of $F$ under consideration are contained in a fixed algebraic closure $\bar{F}$ of $F$. The Isomorphism Extension Theorem shows that the mapping $\psi_{\alpha, \beta}$ can indeed always be extended to an isomorphism of $E$ onto a subfield of $\bar{F}$. Whether this extension gives an automorphism of $E$, that is, maps $E$ into itself, is a question we shall study in Section 50 . Thus this extension theorem, used in conjunction with our conjugation isomorphisms $\psi_{\alpha, \beta}$ will guarantee the existence of lots of isomorphism mappings, at least, for many fields. Extension theorems are very important in mathematics, particularly in algebraic and topological situations.

Let us take a more general look at this situation. Suppose that $E$ is an algebraic extension of a field $F$ and that we have an isomorphism $\sigma$ of $F$ onto a field $F^{\prime}$. Let $\overline{F^{\prime}}$ be an algebraic closure of $F^{\prime}$. We would like to extend $\sigma$ to an isomorphism $\tau$ of $E$ onto a subfield of $\overline{F^{\prime}}$. This situation is shown in Fig. 49.2. Naively, we pick $\alpha \in E$ but not in $F$ and try to extend $\sigma$ to $F(\alpha)$. If

$$
p(x)=\operatorname{irr}(\alpha, F)=a_{0}+a_{1} x+\cdots+a_{n} x^{n},
$$

let $\beta$ be a zero in $\overline{F^{\prime}}$ of

$$
q(x)=\sigma\left(a_{0}\right)+\sigma\left(a_{1}\right) x+\cdots+\sigma\left(a_{n}\right) x^{n} .
$$

Here $q(x) \in F^{\prime}[x]$. Since $\sigma$ is an isomorphism, we know that $q(x)$ is irreducible in $F^{\prime}[x]$. It seems reasonable that $F(\alpha)$ can be mapped isomorphically onto $F^{\prime}(\beta)$ by a map extending $\sigma$ and mapping $\alpha$ onto $\beta$. (This is not quite Theorem 48.3, but it is close to it; a few elements have been renamed by the isomorphism $\sigma$.) If $F(\alpha)=E$, we are done. If $F(\alpha) \neq E$, we have to find another element in $E$ not in $F(\alpha)$ and continue the process. It is a situation very much like that in the construction of an algebraic closure $\bar{F}$ of a field $F$. Again the trouble is that, in general, where $E$ is not a finite extension, the process may have to be repeated a (possibly large) infinite number of times, so we need Zorn's lemma to handle it. For this reason, we postpone the general proof of Theorem 49.3 to the end of this section.

49.3 Theorem (Isomorphism Extension Theorem) Let $E$ be an algebraic extension of a field $F$. Let $\sigma$ be an isomorphism of $F$ onto a field $F^{\prime}$. Let $\overline{F^{\prime}}$ be an algebraic closure of $F^{\prime}$. Then $\sigma$
can be extended to an isomorphism $\tau$ of $E$ onto a subfield of $\overline{F^{\prime}}$ such that $\tau(a)=\sigma(a)$ for all $a \in F$.

We give as a corollary the existence of an extension of one of our conjugation isomorphisms $\psi_{\alpha, \beta}$, as discussed at the start of this section.

49.4 Corollary If $E \leq \bar{F}$ is an algebraic extension of $F$ and $\alpha, \beta \in E$ are conjugate over $F$, then the conjugation isomorphism $\psi_{\alpha, \beta}: F(\alpha) \rightarrow F(\beta)$, given by Theorem 48.3 , can be extended to an isomorphism of $E$ onto a subfield of $\bar{F}$.

Proof Proof of this corollary is immediate from Theorem 49.3 if in the statement of the theorem we replace $F$ by $F(\alpha), F^{\prime}$ by $F(\beta)$, and $\overline{F^{\prime}}$ by $\bar{F}$.

As another corollary, we can show, as we promised earlier, that an algebraic closure of $F$ is unique, up to an isomorphism leaving $F$ fixed.

49.5 Corollary Let $\bar{F}$ and $\overline{F^{\prime}}$ be two algebraic closures of $F$. Then $\bar{F}$ is isomorphic to $\overline{F^{\prime}}$ under an isomorphism leaving each element of $F$ fixed.

Proof By Theorem 49.3, the identity isomorphism of $F$ onto $F$ can be extended to an isomorphism $\tau$ mapping $\bar{F}$ onto a subfield of $\overline{F^{\prime}}$ that leaves $F$ fixed (see Fig. 49.6). We need only show that $\tau$ is onto $\overline{F^{\prime}}$. But by Theorem 49.3 , the map $\tau^{-1}: \tau[\bar{F}] \rightarrow \bar{F}$ can be extended to an isomorphism of $\overline{F^{\prime}}$ onto a subfield of $\bar{F}$. Since $\tau^{-1}$ is already onto $\bar{F}$, we must have $\tau[\bar{F}]=\overline{F^{\prime}}$.

## The Index of a Field Extension

Having discussed the question of existence, we turn now to the question of how many. For a finite extension $E$ of a field $F$, we would like to count how many isomorphisms there are of $E$ onto a subfield of $\bar{F}$ that leave $F$ fixed. We shall show that there are only a finite number of isomorphisms. Since every automorphism in $G(E / F)$ is such an isomorphism, a count of these isomorphisms will include all these automorphisms. Example 48.17 showed that $G(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}) / \mathbb{Q})$ has four elements, and that $4=[\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}): \mathbb{Q}]$. While such an equality is not always true, it is true in a very important case. The next theorem
takes the first big step in proving this. We state the theorem in more general terms than we shall need, but it does not make the proof any harder.

49.7 Theorem Let $E$ be a finite extension of a field $F$. Let $\sigma$ be an isomorphism of $F$ onto a field $F^{\prime}$, and let $\overline{F^{\prime}}$ be an algebraic closure of $F^{\prime}$. Then the number of extensions of $\sigma$ to an isomorphism $\tau$ of $E$ onto a subfield of $\overline{F^{\prime}}$ is finite, and independent of $F^{\prime}, \overline{F^{\prime}}$, and $\sigma$. That is, the number of extensions is completely determined by the two fields $E$ and $F$; it is intrinsic to them.

Proof The diagram in Fig. 49.8 may help us to follow the construction that we are about to make. This diagram is constructed in the following way. Consider two isomorphisms

$$
\sigma_{1}: F \stackrel{\text { onto }}{\longrightarrow} F_{1}^{\prime}, \quad \sigma_{2}: F \stackrel{\text { onto }}{\longrightarrow} F_{2}^{\prime},
$$

where $\overline{F_{1}^{\prime}}$ and $\overline{F_{2}^{\prime}}$ are algebraic closures of $F_{1}^{\prime}$ and $F_{2}^{\prime}$, respectively. Now $\sigma_{2} \sigma_{1}^{-1}$ is an isomorphism of $F_{1}^{\prime}$ onto $F_{2}^{\prime}$. Then by Theorem 49.3 and Corollary 49.5 there is an isomorphism

$$
\lambda: \overline{F_{1}^{\prime}} \stackrel{\text { onto }}{\longrightarrow} \overline{F_{2}^{\prime}}
$$

extending this isomorphism $\sigma_{2} \sigma_{1}^{-1}: F_{1}^{\prime} \xrightarrow{\text { onto }} F_{2}^{\prime}$. Referring to Fig. 49.8, corresponding to each $\tau_{1}: E \rightarrow \overline{F_{1}^{\prime}}$ that extends $\sigma_{1}$ we obtain an isomorphism $\tau_{2}: E \rightarrow \overline{F_{2}^{\prime}}$, by starting at $E$ and going first to the left, then up, and then to the right. Written algebraically,

$$
\tau_{2}(\alpha)=\left(\lambda \tau_{1}\right)(\alpha)
$$

for $\alpha \in E$. Clearly $\tau_{2}$ extends $\sigma_{2}$. The fact that we could have started with $\tau_{2}$ and recovered $\tau_{1}$ by defining

$$
\tau_{1}(\alpha)=\left(\lambda^{-1} \tau_{2}\right)(\alpha)
$$

that is, by chasing the other way around the diagram, shows that the correspondence between $\tau_{1}: E \rightarrow \overline{F_{1}^{\prime}}$ and $\tau_{2}: E \rightarrow \overline{F_{2}^{\prime}}$ is one to one. In view of this one-to-one correspondence, the number of $\tau$ extending $\sigma$ is independent of $F^{\prime}, \overline{F^{\prime}}$ and $\sigma$.

That the number of mappings extending $\sigma$ is finite follows from the fact that since $E$ is a finite extension of $F, E=F\left(\alpha_{1}, \cdots, \alpha_{n}\right)$ for some $\alpha_{1}, \cdots, \alpha_{n}$ in $E$, by Theorem 31.11.

There are only a finite number of possible candiates for the images $\tau\left(\alpha_{i}\right)$ in $\overline{F^{\prime}}$, for if

$$
\operatorname{irr}\left(\alpha_{i}, F\right)=a_{i 0}+a_{i 1} x+\cdots+a_{i m_{i}} x^{m_{i}}
$$

where $a_{i k} \in F$, then $\tau\left(\alpha_{i}\right)$ must be one of the zeros in $\overline{F^{\prime}}$ of

$$
\left[\sigma\left(a_{i 0}\right)+\sigma\left(a_{i 1}\right) x+\cdots+\sigma\left(a_{i m_{i}}\right) x^{m_{i}}\right] \in F^{\prime}[x] .
$$

49.9 Definition Let $E$ be a finite extension of a field $F$. The number of isomorphisms of $E$ onto a subfield of $\bar{F}$ leaving $F$ fixed is the index $\{E: F\}$ of $E$ over $F$.

49.10 Corollary If $F \leq E \leq K$, where $K$ is a finite extension field of the field $F$, then $\{K: F\}=$ $\{K: E\}\{E: F\}$.

Proof It follows from Theorem 49.7 that each of the $\{E: F\}$ isomorphisms $\tau_{i}$ of $E$ onto a subfield of $\bar{F}$ leaving $F$ fixed has $\{K: E\}$ extensions to an isomorphism of $K$ onto a subfield of $\bar{F}$.

The preceding corollary was really the main thing we were after. Note that it counts something. Never underestimate a result that counts something, even if it is only called a "corollary."

We shall show in Section 51 that unless $F$ is an infinite field of characteristics $p \neq 0$, we always have $[E: F]=\{E: F\}$ for every finite extension field $E$ of $F$. For the case $E=F(\alpha)$, the $\{F(\alpha): F\}$ extensions of the identity map $\iota: F \rightarrow F$ to maps of $F(\alpha)$ onto a subfield of $\bar{F}$ are given by the conjugation isomorphisms $\psi_{\alpha, \beta}$ for each conjugate $\beta$ in $\bar{F}$ of $\alpha$ over $F$. Thus if $\operatorname{irr}(\alpha, F)$ has $n$ distinct zeros in $\bar{F}$, we have $\{E: F\}=n$. We shall show later that unless $F$ is infinite and of characteristic $p \neq 0$, the number of distinct zeros of $\operatorname{irr}(\alpha, F)$ is $\operatorname{deg}(\alpha, F)=[F(\alpha): F]$.

49.11 Example $\quad$ Consider $E=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3})$ over $\mathbb{Q}$, as in Example 48.17. Our work in that example shows that $\{E: \mathbb{Q}\}=[E: \mathbb{Q}]=4$. Also, $\{E: \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})\}=2$, and $\{\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}): \mathbb{Q}\}=2$, so

$$
4=\{E: \mathbb{Q}\}=\{E: \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})\}\{\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}): \mathbb{Q}\}=(2)(2)
$$

This illustrates Corollary 49.10

## Proof of the Extension Theorem

We restate the Isomorphism Extension Theorem 49.3.

Isomorphism Extension Theorem Let $E$ be an algebraic extension of a field $F$. Let $\sigma$ be an isomorphism of $F$ onto a field $F^{\prime}$. Let $\overline{F^{\prime}}$ be an algebraic closure of $F^{\prime}$. Then $\sigma$ can be extended to an isomorphism $\tau$ of $E$ onto a subfield of $\overline{F^{\prime}}$ such that $\tau(a)=\sigma(a)$ for $a \in F$.

Proof Consider all pairs $(L, \lambda)$, where $L$ is a field such that $F \leq L \leq E$ and $\lambda$ is an isomorphism of $L$ onto a subfield of $\overline{F^{\prime}}$ such that $\lambda(a)=\sigma(a)$ for $a \in F$. The set $S$ of such
pairs $(L, \lambda)$ is nonempty, since $(F, \sigma)$ is such a pair. Define a partial ordering on $S$ by $\left(L_{1}, \lambda_{1}\right) \leq\left(L_{2}, \lambda_{2}\right)$, if $L_{1} \leq L_{2}$ and $\lambda_{1}(a)=\lambda_{2}(a)$ for $a \in L_{1}$. It is readily checked that this relation $\leq$ does give a partial ordering of $S$.

Let $T=\left\{\left(H_{i}, \lambda_{i}\right) \mid i \in I\right\}$ be a chain of $S$. We claim that $H=\bigcup_{i \in I} H_{i}$ is a subfield of $E$. Let $a, b \in H$, where $a \in H_{1}$ and $b \in H_{2}$; then either $H_{1} \leq H_{2}$ or $H_{2} \leq H_{1}$, since $T$ is a chain. If, say, $H_{1} \leq H_{2}$, then $a, b, \in H_{2}$, so $a \pm b, a b$, and $a / b$ for $b \neq 0$ are all in $H_{2}$ and hence in $H$. Since for each $i \in I, F \subseteq H_{i} \subseteq E$, we have $F \subseteq H \subseteq E$. Thus $H$ is a subfield of $E$.

Define $\lambda: H \rightarrow \overline{F^{\prime}}$ as follows. Let $c \in H$. Then $c \in H_{i}$ for some $i \in I$, and let

$$
\lambda(c)=\lambda_{i}(c)
$$

The map $\lambda$ is well defined because if $c \in H_{1}$ and $c \in H_{2}$, then either $\left(H_{1}, \lambda_{1}\right) \leq\left(H_{2}, \lambda_{2}\right)$ or $\left(H_{2}, \lambda_{2}\right) \leq\left(H_{1}, \lambda_{1}\right)$, since $T$ is a chain. In either case, $\lambda_{1}(c)=\lambda_{2}(c)$. We claim that $\lambda$ is an isomorphism of $H$ onto a subfield of $\overline{F^{\prime}}$. If $a, b \in H$ then there is an $H_{i}$ such that $a, b \in H_{i}$, and

$$
\lambda(a+b)=\lambda_{i}(a+b)=\lambda_{i}(a)+\lambda_{i}(b)=\lambda(a)+\lambda(b)
$$

Similarly,

$$
\lambda(a b)=\lambda_{i}(a b)=\lambda_{i}(a) \lambda_{i}(b)=\lambda(a) \lambda(b) .
$$

If $\lambda(a)=0$, then $a \in H_{i}$ for some $i$ implies that $\lambda_{i}(a)=0$, so $a=0$. Therefore, $\lambda$ is an isomorphism. Thus $(H, \lambda) \in S$, and it is clear from our definitions of $H$ and $\lambda$ that $(H, \lambda)$ is an upper bound for $T$.

We have shown that every chain of $S$ has an upper bound in $S$, so the hypotheses of Zorn's lemma are satisfied. Hence there exists a maximal element $(K, \tau)$ of $S$. Let $\tau(K)=K^{\prime}$, where $K^{\prime} \leq \overline{F^{\prime}}$. Now if $K \neq E$, let $\alpha \in E$ but $\alpha \notin K$. Now $\alpha$ is algebraic over $F$, so $\alpha$ is algebraic over $K$. Also, let $p(x)=\operatorname{irr}(\alpha, K)$. Let $\psi_{\alpha}$ be the canonical isomorphism

$$
\psi_{\alpha}: K[x] /\langle p(x)\rangle \rightarrow K(\alpha)
$$

corresponding to the evaluation homomorphism $\phi_{\alpha}: K[x] \rightarrow K(\alpha)$. If

$$
p(x)=a_{0}+a_{1} x+\cdots+a_{n} x^{n}
$$

consider

$$
q(x)=\tau\left(a_{0}\right)+\tau\left(a_{1}\right) x+\cdots+\tau\left(a_{n}\right) x^{n}
$$

in $K^{\prime}[x]$. Since $\tau$ is an isomorphism, $q(x)$ is irreducible in $K^{\prime}[x]$. Since $K^{\prime} \leq \overline{F^{\prime}}$, there is a zero $\alpha^{\prime}$ of $q(x)$ in $\overline{F^{\prime}}$. Let

$$
\psi_{\alpha^{\prime}}: K^{\prime}[x] /\langle q(x)\rangle \rightarrow K^{\prime}\left(\alpha^{\prime}\right)
$$

49.12 Figure

be the isomorphism analogous to $\psi_{\alpha}$. Finally, let

$$
\bar{\tau}: K[x] /\langle p(x)\rangle \rightarrow K^{\prime}[x] /\langle q(x)\rangle
$$

be the isomorphism extending $\tau$ on $K$ and mapping $x+\langle p(x)\rangle$ onto $x+\langle q(x)\rangle$. (See Fig. 49.12.) Then the composition of maps

$$
\psi_{\alpha^{\prime}} \bar{\tau} \psi_{\alpha}^{-1}: K(\alpha) \rightarrow K^{\prime}\left(\alpha^{\prime}\right)
$$

is an isomorphism of $K(\alpha)$ onto a subfield of $\overline{F^{\prime}}$. Clearly, $(K, \tau)<\left(K(\alpha), \psi_{\alpha^{\prime}} \bar{\tau} \psi_{\alpha}^{-1}\right)$, which contradicts that $(K, \tau)$ is maximal. Therefore we must have had $K=E$.

\alpha_{1}=\sqrt[3]{2}, \quad \alpha_{2}=\sqrt[3]{2} \frac{-1+i \sqrt{3}}{2}, \quad \text { and } \quad \alpha_{3}=\sqrt[3]{2} \frac{-1-i \sqrt{3}}{2}

Use the fact that a finite extension is a tower of simple extensions, together with the multiplicative properties of the index and degree.]

## Section 50 Splitting Fields

We are going to be interested chiefly in automorphisms of a field $E$, rather than mere isomorphic mappings of $E$ onto a subfield of $\bar{E}$. It is the automorphisms of a field that form a group. We wonder whether for some extension field $E$ of a field $F$, every isomorphic mapping of $E$ onto a subfield of $\bar{F}$ leaving $F$ fixed is actually an automorphism of $E$.

Suppose $E$ is an algebraic extension of a field $E$. If $\alpha \in E$ and $\beta \in \bar{F}$ is a conjugate of $\alpha$ over $F$, then there is a conjugation isomorphism

$$
\psi_{\alpha, \beta}: F(\alpha) \rightarrow F(\beta)
$$

By Corollary 49.4, $\psi_{\alpha, \beta}$ can be extended to an isomorphic mapping of $E$ onto a subfield of $\bar{F}$. Now if $\beta \notin E$, such an isomorphic mapping of $E$ can't be an automorphism of $E$. Thus, if an algebraic extension $E$ of a field $F$ is such that all its isomorphic mappings onto
a subfield of $\bar{F}$ leaving $F$ fixed are actually automorphisms of $E$, then for every $\alpha \in E$, all conjugates of $\alpha$ over $F$ must be in $E$ also. This observation seemed to come very easily. We point out that we used a lot of power, namely the existence of the conjugation isomorphisms and the Isomorphism Extension Theorem 49.3.

These ideas suggest the formulation of the following definition.

50.1 Definition Let $F$ be a field with algebraic closure $\bar{F}$. Let $\left\{f_{i}(x) \mid i \in I\right\}$ be a collection of polynomials in $F[x]$. A field $E \leq \bar{F}$ is the splitting field of $\left\{f_{i}(x) \mid i \in I\right\}$ over $F$ if $E$ is the smallest subfield of $\bar{F}$ containing $F$ and all the zeros in $\bar{F}$ of each of the $f_{i}(x)$ for $i \in I$. A field $K \leq \bar{F}$ is a splitting field over $F$ if it is the splitting field of some set of polynomials in $F[x]$.

50.2 Example We see that $\mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}]$ is a splitting field of $\left\{x^{2}-2, x^{2}-3\right\}$ and also of $\left\{x^{4}-5 x^{2}+6\right\}$.

For one polynomial $f(x) \in F[x]$, we shall often refer to the splitting field of $\{f(x)\}$ over $F$ as the splitting field of $f(x)$ over $F$. Note that the splitting field of $\left\{f_{i}(x) \mid i \in I\right\}$ over $F$ in $\bar{F}$ is the intersection of all subfields of $\bar{F}$ containing $F$ and all zeros in $\bar{F}$ of each $f_{i}(x)$ for $i \in I$. Thus such a splitting field surely does exist.

We now show that splitting fields over $F$ are precisely those fields $E \leq \bar{F}$ with the property that all isomorphic mappings of $E$ onto a subfield of $\bar{F}$ leaving $F$ fixed are automorphisms of $E$. This will be a corollary of the next theorem. Once more, we are characterizing a concept in terms of mappings. Remember, we are always assuming that all algebraic extensions of a field $F$ under consideration are in one fixed algebraic closure $\bar{F}$ of $F$.

50.3 Theorem A field $E$, where $F \leq E \leq \bar{F}$, is a splitting field over $F$ if and only if every automorphism of $\bar{F}$ leaving $F$ fixed maps $E$ onto itself and thus induces an automorphism of $E$ leaving $F$ fixed.

Proof Let $E$ be a splitting field over $F$ in $\bar{F}$ of $\left\{f_{i}(x) \mid i \in I\right\}$, and let $\sigma$ be an automorphism of $\bar{F}$ leaving $F$ fixed. Let $\left\{\alpha_{j} \mid j \in J\right\}$ be the collection of all zeros in $\bar{F}$ of all the $f_{i}(x)$ for $i \in I$. Now our previous work shows that for a fixed $\alpha_{j}$, the field $F\left(\alpha_{j}\right)$ has as elements all expressions of the form

$$
g\left(\alpha_{j}\right)=a_{0}+a_{1} \alpha_{j}+\cdots+a_{n_{j}-1} \alpha_{j}^{n_{j}-1}
$$

where $n_{j}$ is the degree of $\operatorname{irr}\left(\alpha_{j}, F\right)$ and $a_{k} \in F$. Consider the set $S$ of all finite sums of finite products of elements of the form $g\left(\alpha_{j}\right)$ for all $j \in J$. The set $S$ is a subset of $E$ closed under addition and multiplication and containing 0,1 , and the additive inverse of each element. Since each element of $S$ is in some $F\left(\alpha_{j_{1}}, \cdots, \alpha_{j_{r}}\right) \subseteq S$, we see that $S$ also contains the multiplicative inverse of each nonzero element. Thus $S$ is a subfield of $E$ containing all $\alpha_{j}$ for $j \in J$. By definition of the splitting field $E$ of $\left\{f_{i}(x) \mid i \in I\right\}$, we see that we must have $S=E$. All this work was just to show that $\left\{\alpha_{j} \mid j \in J\right\}$ generates $E$ over $F$, in the sense of taking finite sums and finite products. Knowing this, we see immediately that the value of $\sigma$ on any element of $E$ is completely determined by the values $\sigma\left(\alpha_{j}\right)$. But by Corollary 48.5, $\sigma\left(\alpha_{j}\right)$ must also be a zero of $\operatorname{irr}\left(\alpha_{j}, F\right)$. By

Theorem 29.13, $\operatorname{irr}\left(\alpha_{j}, F\right)$ divides the $f_{i}(x)$ for which $f_{i}\left(\alpha_{j}\right)=0$, so $\sigma\left(\alpha_{j}\right) \in E$ also. Thus $\sigma$ maps $E$ onto a subfield of $E$ isomorphically. However, the same is true of the automorphism $\sigma^{-1}$ of $\bar{F}$. Since for $\beta \in E$,

$$
\beta=\sigma\left(\sigma^{-1}(\beta)\right),
$$

we see that $\sigma$ maps $E$ onto $E$, and thus induces an automorphism of $E$.

Suppose, conversely, that every automorphism of $\bar{F}$ leaving $F$ fixed induces an automorphism of $E$. Let $g(x)$ be an irreducible polynomial in $F[x]$ having a zero $\alpha$ in $E$. If $\beta$ is any zero of $g(x)$ in $\bar{F}$, then by Theorem 48.3, there is a conjugation isomorphism $\psi_{\alpha, \beta}$ of $F(\alpha)$ onto $F(\beta)$ leaving $F$ fixed. By Theorem $49.3, \psi_{\alpha, \beta}$ can be extended to an isomorphism $\tau$ of $\bar{F}$ onto a subfield of $\bar{F}$. But then

$$
\tau^{-1}: \tau[\bar{F}] \rightarrow \bar{F}
$$

can be extended to an isomorphism mapping $\bar{F}$ onto a subfield of $\bar{F}$. Since the image of $\tau^{-1}$ is already all of $\bar{F}$, we see that $\tau$ must have been onto $\bar{F}$, so $\tau$ is an automorphism of $\bar{F}$ leaving $F$ fixed. Then by assumption, $\tau$ induces an automorphism of $E$, so $\tau(\alpha)=\beta$ is in $E$. We have shown that if $g(x)$ is an irreducible polynomial in $F[x]$ having one zero in $E$, then all zeros of $g(x)$ in $\bar{F}$ are in $E$. Hence if $\left\{g_{k}(x)\right\}$ is the set of all irreducible polynomials in $F[x]$ having a zero in $E$, then $E$ is the splitting field of $\left\{g_{k}(x)\right\}$.

50.4 Definition Let $E$ be an extension field of a field $F$. A polynomial $f(x) \in F[x]$ splits in $E$ if it factors into a product of linear factors in $E[x]$.

50.5 Example The polynomial $x^{4}-5 x^{2}+6$ in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$ splits in the field $\mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}]$ into $(x-\sqrt{2})(x+\sqrt{2})(x-\sqrt{3})(x+\sqrt{3})$.

50.6 Corollary If $E \leq \bar{F}$ is a splitting field over $F$, then every irreducible polynomial in $F[x]$ having a zero in $E$ splits in $E$.

Proof If $E$ is a splitting field over $F$ in $\bar{F}$, then every automorphism of $\bar{F}$ induces an automorphism of $E$. The second half of the proof of Theorem 50.3 showed precisely that $E$ is also the splitting field over $F$ of the set $\left\{g_{k}(x)\right\}$ of all irreducible polynomials in $F[x]$ having a zero in $E$. Thus an irreducible polynomial $f(x)$ of $F[x]$ having a zero in $E$ has all its zeros in $\bar{F}$ in $E$. Therefore, its factorization into linear factors in $\bar{F}[x]$, given by Theorem 31.15 , actually takes place in $E[x]$, so $f(x)$ splits in $E$.

50.7 Corollary If $E \leq \bar{F}$ is a splitting field over $F$, then every isomorphic mapping of $E$ onto a subfield of $\bar{F}$ and leaving $F$ fixed is actually an automorphism of $E$. In particular, if $E$ is a splitting field of finite degree over $F$, then

$$
\{E: F\}=|G(E / F)| .
$$

Proof Every isomorphism $\sigma$ mapping $E$ onto a subfield of $\bar{F}$ leaving $F$ fixed can be extended to an automorphism $\tau$ of $\bar{F}$, by Theorem 49.3, together with the onto argument of the second half of the proof of Theorem 50.3. If $E$ is a splitting field over $F$, then by Theorem 50.3, $\tau$ restricted to $E$, that is $\sigma$, is an automorphism of $E$. Thus for a splitting field $E$ over $F$, every isomorphic mapping of $E$ onto a subfield of $\bar{F}$ leaving $F$ fixed is an automorphism of $E$.

The equation $\{E: F\}=|G(E / F)|$ then follows immediately for a splitting field $E$ of finite degree over $F$, since $\{E: F\}$ was defined as the number of different isomorphic mappings of $E$ onto a subfield of $\bar{F}$ leaving $F$ fixed.

50.8 Example Observe that $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3})$ is the splitting field of

$$
\left\{x^{2}-2, x^{2}-3\right\}
$$

over $\mathbb{Q}$. Example 48.17 showed that the mappings $\iota, \sigma_{1}, \sigma_{2}$, and $\sigma_{3}$ are all the automorphisms of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3})$ leaving $\mathbb{Q}$ fixed. (Actually, since every automorphism of a field must leave the prime subfield fixed, we see that these are the only automorphisms of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3})$.) Then

$$
\{\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}): \mathbb{Q}\}=|G(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}) / \mathbb{Q})|=4
$$

illustrating Corollary 50.7.

We wish to determine conditions under which

$$
|G(E / F)|=\{E: F\}=[E: F]
$$

for finite extensions $E$ of $F$. This is our next topic. We shall show in the following section that this equation always holds when $E$ is a splitting field over a field $F$ of characteristic 0 or when $F$ is a finite field. This equation need not be true when $F$ is an infinite field of characteristic $p \neq 0$.

50.9 Example Let $\sqrt[3]{2}$ be the real cube root of 2, as usual. Now $x^{3}-2$ does not split in $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2})$, for $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2})<\mathbb{R}$ and only one zero of $x^{3}-2$ is real. Thus $x^{3}-2$ factors in $(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2}))[x]$ into a linear factor $x-\sqrt[3]{2}$ and an irreducible quadratic factor. The splitting field $E$ of $x^{3}-2$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ is therefore of degree 2 over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2})$. Then

$$
[E: \mathbb{Q}]=[E: \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2})][\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2}): \mathbb{Q}]=(2)(3)=6 .
$$

We have shown that the splitting field over $\mathbb{Q}$ of $x^{3}-2$ is of degree 6 over $\mathbb{Q}$.

We can verify by cubing that

$$
\sqrt[3]{2} \frac{-1+i \sqrt{3}}{2} \quad \text { and } \quad \sqrt[3]{2} \frac{-1-i \sqrt{3}}{2}
$$

are the other zeros of $x^{3}-2$ in $\mathbb{C}$. Thus the splitting field $E$ of $x^{3}-2$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ is $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2}, i \sqrt{3})$. (This is not the same field as $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2}, i, \sqrt{3})$, which is of degree 12 over $\mathbb{Q}$.) Further study of this interesting example is left to the exercises (see Exercises 7, 8, 9, 16,21 , and 23 ).

## Section 51 Separable Extensions

## Multiplicity of Zeros of a Polynomial

Remember that we are now always assuming that all algebraic extensions of a field $F$ under consideration are contained in one fixed algebraic closure $\bar{F}$ of $F$.

Our next aim is to determine, for a finite extension $E$ of $F$, under what conditions $\{E: F\}=[E: F]$. The key to answering this question is to consider the multiplicity of zeros of polynomials.

51.1 Definition Let $f(x) \in F[x]$. An element $\alpha$ of $\bar{F}$ such that $f(\alpha)=0$ is a zero of $f(x)$ of multiplicity $v$ if $v$ is the greatest integer such that $(x-\alpha)^{v}$ is a factor of $f(x)$ in $\bar{F}[x]$.

The next theorem shows that the multiplicities of the zeros of one given irreducible polynomial over a field are all the same. The ease with which we can prove this theorem is a further indication of the power of our conjugation isomorphisms and of our whole approach to the study of zeros of polynomials by means of mappings.

51.2 Theorem Let $f(x)$ be irreducible in $F[x]$. Then all zeros of $f(x)$ in $\bar{F}$ have the same multiplicity.

Proof Let $\alpha$ and $\beta$ be zeros of $f(x)$ in $\bar{F}$. Then by Theorem 48.3, there is a conjugation isomorphism $\psi_{\alpha, \beta}: F(\alpha) \xrightarrow{\text { onto }} F(\beta)$. By Corollary $49.4, \psi_{\alpha, \beta}$ can be extended to an isomorphism $\tau: \bar{F} \rightarrow \bar{F}$. Then $\tau$ induces a natural isomorphism $\tau_{x}: \bar{F}[x] \rightarrow \bar{F}[x]$, with $\tau_{x}(x)=x$. Now $\tau_{x}$ leaves $f(x)$ fixed, since $f(x) \in F[x]$ and $\psi_{\alpha, \beta}$ leaves $F$ fixed. However,

$$
\tau_{x}\left((x-\alpha)^{v}\right)=(x-\beta)^{v},
$$

which shows that the multiplicity of $\beta$ in $f(x)$ is greater than or equal to the multiplicity of $\alpha$. A symmetric argument gives the reverse inequality, so the multiplicity of $\alpha$ equals that of $\beta$.

51.3 Corollary If $f(x)$ is irreducible in $F[x]$, then $f(x)$ has a factorization in $\bar{F}[x]$ of the form

$$
a \prod_{i}\left(x-\alpha_{i}\right)^{v}
$$

where the $\alpha_{i}$ are the distinct zeros of $f(x)$ in $\bar{F}$ and $a \in F$.

Proof The corollary is immediate from Theorem 51.2.

At this point, we should probably show by an example that the phenomenon of a zero of multiplicity greater than 1 of an irreducible polynomial can occur. We shall show later in this section that it can only occur for a polynomial over an infinite field of characteristic $p \neq 0$.

51.4 Example Let $E=\mathbb{Z}_{p}(y)$, where $y$ is an indeterminate. Let $t=y^{p}$, and let $F$ be the subfield $\mathbb{Z}_{p}(t)$ of $E$. (See Fig. 51.5.) Now $E=F(y)$ is algebraic over $F$, for $y$ is a zero of $\left(x^{p}-t\right) \in F[x]$. By Theorem 29.13, $\operatorname{irr}(y, F)$ must divide $x^{p}-t$ in $F[x]$. [Actually, $\operatorname{irr}(y, F)=x^{p}-t$. We leave a proof of this to the exercises (see Exercise 10).] Since $F(y)$ is not equal to $F$, we must have the degree of $\operatorname{irr}(y, F) \geq 2$. But note that

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_01_27_9289ad7bed1dd2e5e553g-408.jpg?height=390&width=230&top_left_y=1708&top_left_x=362)

51.5 Figure

$$
x^{p}-t=x^{p}-y^{p}=(x-y)^{p} \text {, }
$$

since $E$ has characteristic $p$ (see Theorem 48.19 and the following comment). Thus $y$ is a zero of $\operatorname{irr}(y, F)$ of multiplicity $>1$. Actually, $x^{p}-t=\operatorname{irr}(y, F)$, so the multiplicity of $y$ is $p$.

From here on we rely heavily on Theorem 49.7 and its corollary. Theorem 48.3 and its corollary show that for a simple algebraic extension $F(\alpha)$ of $F$ there is one extension of the identity isomorphism $\iota$ mapping $F$ into $F$ for every distinct zero of $\operatorname{irr}(\alpha, F)$ and that these are the only extensions of $\iota$. Thus $\{F(\alpha): F\}$ is the number of distinct zeros of $\operatorname{irr}(\alpha, F)$.

In view of our work with the theorem of Lagrange and Theorem 31.4, we should recognize the potential of a theorem like this next one.

51.6 Theorem If $E$ is a finite extension of $F$, then $\{E: F\}$ divides $[E: F]$.

Proof By Theorem 31.11, if $E$ is finite over $F$, then $E=F\left(\alpha_{1}, \cdots, \alpha_{n}\right)$, where $\alpha_{i} \in \bar{F}$. Let $\operatorname{irr}\left(\alpha_{i}, F\left(\alpha_{1}, \cdots, \alpha_{i-1}\right)\right)$ have $\alpha_{i}$ as one of $n_{i}$ distinct zeros that are all of a common multiplicity $v_{i}$, by Theorem 51.2. Then

$$
\left[F\left(\alpha_{1}, \cdots, \alpha_{i}\right): F\left(\alpha_{1}, \cdots, \alpha_{i-1}\right)\right]=n_{i} v_{i}=\left\{F\left(\alpha_{1}, \cdots, \alpha_{i}\right): F\left(\alpha_{1}, \cdots, \alpha_{i-1}\right)\right\} v_{i}
$$

By Theorem 31.4 and Corollary 49.10,

$$
[E: F]=\prod_{i} n_{i} v_{i}
$$

and

$$
\{E: F\}=\prod_{i} n_{i} .
$$

Therefore, $\{E: F\}$ divides $[E: F]$.

## Separable Extensions

51.7 Definition A finite extension $E$ of $F$ is a separable extension of $F$ if $\{E: F\}=[E: F]$. An element $\alpha$ of $\bar{F}$ is separable over $F$ if $F(\alpha)$ is a separable extension of $F$. An irreducible polynomial $f(x) \in F[x]$ is separable over $F$ if every zero of $f(x)$ in $\bar{F}$ is separable over $F$.

51.8 Example The field $E=\mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}]$ is separable over $\mathbb{Q}$ since we saw in Example 50.8 that $\{E: \mathbb{Q}\}=4=[E: \mathbb{Q}]$.

To make things a little easier, we have restricted our definition of a separable extension of a field $F$ to finite extensions $E$ of $F$. For the corresponding definition for infinite extensions, see Exercise 12.

We know that $\{F(\alpha): F\}$ is the number of distinct zeros of $\operatorname{irr}(\alpha, F)$. Also, the multiplicity of $\alpha \operatorname{in} \operatorname{irr}(\alpha, F)$ is the same as the multiplicity of each conjugate of $\alpha$ over $F$, by Theorem 51.2. Thus $\alpha$ is separable over $F$ if and only if $\operatorname{irr}(\alpha, F)$ has all zeros of multiplicity 1. This tells us at once that an irreducible polynomial $f(x) \in F[x]$ is separable over $F$ if and only if $f(x)$ has all zeros of multiplicity 1.

51.9 Theorem If $K$ is a finite extension of $E$ and $E$ is a finite extension of $F$, that is, $F \leq E \leq K$, then $K$ is separable over $F$ if and only if $K$ is separable over $E$ and $E$ is separable over $F$.

Proof Now

$$
[K: F]=[K: E][E: F],
$$

and

$$
\{K: F\}=\{K: E\}\{E: F\} .
$$

Then if $K$ is separable over $F$, so that $[K: F]=\{K: F\}$, we must have $[K: E]=$ $\{K: E\}$ and $[E: F]=\{E: F\}$, since in each case the index divides the degree, by Theorem 51.6. Thus, if $K$ is separable over $F$, then $K$ is separable over $E$ and $E$ is separable over $F$.

For the converse, note that $[K: E]=\{K: E\}$ and $[E: F]=\{E: F\}$ imply that

$$
[K: F]=[K: E][E: F]=\{K: E\}\{E: F\}=\{K: F\} .
$$

Theorem 51.9 can be extended in the obvious way, by induction, to any finite tower of finite extensions. The top field is a separable extension of the bottom one if and only if each field is a separable extension of the one immediately under it.

51.10 Corollary If $E$ is a finite extension of $F$, then $E$ is separable over $F$ if and only if each $\alpha$ in $E$ is separable over $F$.

Proof Suppose that $E$ is separable over $F$, and let $\alpha \in E$. Then

$$
F \leq F(\alpha) \leq E
$$

and Theorem 51.9 shows that $F(\alpha)$ is separable over $F$.

Suppose, conversely, that every $\alpha \in E$ is separable over $F$. Since $E$ is a finite extension of $F$, there exist $\alpha_{1}, \cdots, \alpha_{n}$ such that

$$
F<F\left(\alpha_{1}\right)<F\left(\alpha_{1}, \alpha_{2}\right)<\cdots<E=F\left(\alpha_{1}, \cdots, \alpha_{n}\right) .
$$

Now since $\alpha_{i}$ is separable over $F, \alpha_{i}$ is separable over $F\left(\alpha_{1}, \cdots, \alpha_{i-1}\right)$, because

$$
q(x)=\operatorname{irr}\left(\alpha_{i}, F\left(\alpha_{1}, \cdots, \alpha_{i-1}\right)\right)
$$

divides $\operatorname{irr}\left(\alpha_{i}, F\right)$, so that $\alpha_{i}$ is a zero of $q(x)$ of multiplicity 1 . Thus $F\left(\alpha_{1}, \cdots, \alpha_{i}\right)$ is separable over $F\left(\alpha_{1}, \cdots, \alpha_{i-1}\right)$, so $E$ is separable over $F$ by Theorem 51.9 , extended by induction.

## Perfect Fields

We now turn to the task of proving that $\alpha$ can fail to be separable over $F$ only if $F$ is an infinite field of characteristic $p \neq 0$. One method is to introduce formal derivatives of polynomials. While this is an elegant technique, and also a useful one, we shall, for the sake of brevity, use the following lemma instead. Formal derivatives are developed in Exercises 15 through 22.

51.11 Lemma Let $\bar{F}$ be an algebraic closure of $F$, and let

$$
f(x)=x^{n}+a_{n-1} x^{n-1}+\cdots+a_{1} x+a_{0}
$$

be any monic polynomial in $\bar{F}[x]$. If $(f(x))^{m} \in F[x]$ and $m \cdot 1 \neq 0$ in $F$, then $f(x) \in$ $F[x]$, that is, all $a_{i} \in F$.

Proof We must show that $a_{i} \in F$, and we proceed, by induction on $r$, to show that $a_{n-r} \in F$. For $r=1$,

$$
(f(x))^{m}=x^{m n}+(m \cdot 1) a_{n-1} x^{m n-1}+\cdots+a_{0}{ }^{m} .
$$

## Part X Automorphisms and Galois Theory

Since $(f(x))^{m} \in F[x]$, we have, in particular,

$$
(m \cdot 1) a_{n-1} \in F
$$

Thus $a_{n-1} \in F$, since $m \cdot 1 \neq 0$ in $F$.

As induction hypothesis, suppose that $a_{n-r} \in F$ for $r=1,2, \cdots, k$. Then the coefficient of $x^{m n-(k+1)}$ in $(f(x))^{m}$ is of the form

$$
(m \cdot 1) a_{n-(k+1)}+g_{k+1}\left(a_{n-1}, a_{n-2}, \cdots, a_{n-k}\right),
$$

where $g_{k+1}\left(a_{n-1}, a_{n-2}, \cdots, a_{n-k}\right)$ is a formal polynomial expression in $a_{n-1}, a_{n-2}, \cdots$, $a_{n-k}$. By the induction hypothesis that we just stated, $g_{k+1}\left(a_{n-1}, a_{n-2}, \cdots, a_{n-k}\right) \in F$, so $a_{n-(k+1)} \in F$, since $m \cdot 1 \neq 0$ in $F$.

We are now in a position to handle fields $F$ of characteristic zero and to show that for a finite extension $E$ of $F$, we have $\{E: F\}=[E: F]$. By definition, this amounts to proving that every finite extension of a field of characteristic zero is a separable extension. First, we give a definition.

51.12 Definition A field is perfect if every finite extension is a separable extension.

51.13 Theorem Every field of characteristic zero is perfect.

Proof Let $E$ be a finite extension of a field $F$ of characteristic zero, and let $\alpha \in E$. Then $f(x)=\operatorname{irr}(\alpha, F)$ factors in $\bar{F}[x]$ into $\prod_{i}\left(x-\alpha_{i}\right)^{\nu}$, where the $\alpha_{i}$ are the distinct zeros of $\operatorname{irr}(\alpha, F)$, and, say, $\alpha=\alpha_{1}$. Thus

$$
f(x)=\left(\prod_{i}\left(x-\alpha_{i}\right)\right)^{v}
$$

and since $v \cdot 1 \neq 0$ for a field $F$ of characteristic 0 , we must have

$$
\left(\prod_{i}\left(x-\alpha_{i}\right)\right) \in F[x]
$$

by Lemma 51.11. Since $f(x)$ is irreducible and of minimal degree in $F[x]$ having $\alpha$ as a zero, we then see that $v=1$. Therefore, $\alpha$ is separable over $F$ for all $\alpha \in E$. By Corollary 51.10 , this means that $E$ is a separable extension of $F$.

Lemma 51.11 will also get us through for the case of a finite field, although the proof is a bit harder.

51.14 Theorem Every finite field is perfect.

Proof Let $F$ be a finite field of characteristic $p$, and let $E$ be a finite extension of $F$. Let $\alpha \in E$. We need to show that $\alpha$ is separable over $F$. Now $f(x)=\operatorname{irr}(\alpha, F)$ factors in $\bar{F}$ into $\prod_{i}\left(x-\alpha_{i}\right)^{v}$, where the $\alpha_{i}$ are the distinct zeros of $f(x)$, and, say, $\alpha=\alpha_{1}$. Let $v=p^{t} e$,
where $p$ does not divide $e$. Then

$$
f(x)=\prod_{i}\left(x-\alpha_{i}\right)^{v}=\left(\prod_{i}\left(x-\alpha_{i}\right)^{p^{t}}\right)^{e}
$$

is in $F[x]$, and by Lemma $51.11, \prod_{i}\left(x-\alpha_{i}\right)^{p^{t}}$ is in $F[x]$ since $e \cdot 1 \neq 0$ in $F$. Since $f(x)=\operatorname{irr}(\alpha, F)$ is of minimal degree over $F$ having $\alpha$ as a zero, we must have $e=1$.

Theorem 48.19 and the remark following it show then that

$$
f(x)=\prod_{i}\left(x-\alpha_{i}\right)^{p^{t}}=\prod_{i}\left(x^{p^{t}}-\alpha_{i}^{p^{t}}\right) .
$$

Thus, if we regard $f(x)$ as $g\left(x^{p^{t}}\right)$, we must have $g(x) \in F[x]$. Now $g(x)$ is separable over $F$ with distinct zeros $\alpha_{i}^{p^{t}}$. Consider $F\left(\alpha_{1}^{p^{t}}\right)=F\left(\alpha^{p^{t}}\right)$. Then $F\left(\alpha^{p^{t}}\right)$ is separable over $F$. Since $x^{p^{t}}-\alpha^{p^{t}}=(x-\alpha)^{p^{t}}$, we see that $\alpha$ is the only zero of $x^{p^{t}}-\alpha^{p^{t}}$ in $\bar{F}$. As a finite-dimensional vector space over a finite field $F, F\left(\alpha^{p^{t}}\right)$ must be again a finite field. Hence the map

$$
\sigma_{p}: F\left(\alpha^{p^{t}}\right) \rightarrow F\left(\alpha^{p^{t}}\right)
$$

given by $\sigma_{p}(a)=a^{p}$ for $a \in F\left(\alpha^{p^{t}}\right)$ is an automorphism of $F\left(\alpha^{p^{t}}\right)$ by Theorem 48.19. Consequently, $\left(\sigma_{p}\right)^{t}$ is also an automorphism of $F\left(\alpha^{p^{t}}\right)$, and

$$
\left(\sigma_{p}\right)^{t}(a)=a^{p^{t}}
$$

Since an automorphism of $F\left(\alpha^{p^{t}}\right)$ is an onto map, there is $\beta \in F\left(\alpha^{p^{t}}\right)$ such that $\left(\sigma_{p}\right)^{t}(\beta)=\alpha^{p^{t}}$. But then $\beta^{p^{t}}=\alpha^{p^{t}}$, and we saw that $\alpha$ was the only zero of $x^{p^{t}}-\alpha^{p^{t}}$, so we must have $\beta=\alpha$. Since $\beta \in F\left(\alpha^{p^{t}}\right)$, we have $F(\alpha)=F\left(\alpha^{p^{t}}\right)$. Since $F\left(\alpha^{p^{t}}\right)$ was separable over $F$, we now see that $F(\alpha)$ is separable over $F$. Therefore, $\alpha$ is separable over $F$ and $t=0$.

We have shown that for $\alpha \in E, \alpha$ is separable over $F$. Then by Corollary $51.10, E$ is a separable extension of $F$.

We have completed our aim, which was to show that fields of characteristic 0 and finite fields have only separable finite extensions, that is, these fields are perfect. For finite extensions $E$ of such perfect fields $F$, we then have $[E: F]=\{E: F\}$.

## The Primitive Element Theorem

The following theorem is a classic of field theory.

51.15 Theorem

(Primitive Element Theorem) Let $E$ be a finite separable extension of a field $F$. Then there exists $\alpha \in E$ such that $E=F(\alpha)$. (Such an element $\alpha$ is a primitive element.) That is, a finite separable extension of a field is a simple extension.

Proof If $F$ is a finite field, then $E$ is also finite. Let $\alpha$ be a generator for the cylic group $E^{*}$ of nonzero elements of $E$ under multiplication. (See Theorem 33.5.) Clearly, $E=F(\alpha)$, so $\alpha$ is a primitive element in this case.

## Part X Automorphisms and Galois Theory

We now assume that $F$ is infinite, and prove our theorem in the case that $E=$ $F(\beta, \gamma)$. The induction argument from this to the general case is straightforward. Let $\operatorname{irr}(\beta, F)$ have distinct zeros $\beta=\beta_{1}, \cdots, \beta_{n}$, and let $\operatorname{irr}(\gamma, F)$ have distinct zeros $\gamma=$ $\gamma_{1}, \cdots, \gamma_{m}$ in $\bar{F}$, where all zeros are of multiplicity 1 , since $E$ is a separable extension of $F$. Since $F$ is infinite, we can find $a \in F$ such that

$$
a \neq\left(\beta_{i}-\beta\right) /\left(\gamma-\gamma_{j}\right)
$$

for all $i$ and $j$, with $j \neq 1$. That is, $a\left(\gamma-\gamma_{j}\right) \neq \beta_{i}-\beta$. Letting $\alpha=\beta+a \gamma$, we have $\alpha=\beta+a \gamma \neq \beta_{i}+a \gamma_{j}$, so

$$
\alpha-a \gamma_{j} \neq \beta_{i}
$$

for all $i$ and all $j \neq 1$. Let $f(x)=\operatorname{irr}(\beta, F)$, and consider

$$
h(x)=f(\alpha-a x) \in(F(\alpha))[x] .
$$

Now $h(\gamma)=f(\beta)=0$. However, $h\left(\gamma_{j}\right) \neq 0$ for $j \neq 1$ by construction, since the $\beta_{i}$ were the only zeros of $f(x)$. Hence $h(x)$ and $g(x)=\operatorname{irr}(\gamma, F)$ have a common factor in $(F(\alpha))[x]$, namely $\operatorname{irr}(\gamma, F(\alpha))$, which must be linear, since $\gamma$ is the only common zero of $g(x)$ and $h(x)$. Thus $\gamma \in F(\alpha)$, and therefore $\beta=\alpha-a \gamma$ is in $F(\alpha)$. Hence $F(\beta, \gamma)=F(\alpha)$.

51.16 Corollary A finite extension of a field of characteristic zero is a simple extension.

Proof This corollary follows at once from Theorems 51.13 and 51.15.

We see that the only possible "bad case" where a finite extension may not be simple is a finite extension of an infinite field of characteristic $p \neq 0$.

$$

## SECTION 52 'TOTALLY INSEPARABLE ExTENSIONS

This section shows that a finite extension $E$ of a field $F$ can be split into two stages: a separable extension $K$ of $F$, followed by a further extension of $K$ to $E$ that is as from being separable as one can imagine.

We develop our theory of totally inseparable extensions in a fashion parallel to our development of separable extensions.

52.1 Definition A finite extension $E$ of a field $F$ is a totally inseparable extension of $F$ if $\{E: F\}=1<$ $[E: F]$. An element $\alpha$ of $\bar{F}$ is totally inseparable over $F$ if $F(\alpha)$ is totally inseparable over $F$.

We know that $\{F(\alpha): F\}$ is the number of distinct zeros $\operatorname{of} \operatorname{irr}(\alpha, F)$. Thus $\alpha$ is totally inseparable over $F$ if and only if $\operatorname{irr}(\alpha, F)$ has only one zero that is of multiplicity $>1$.

52.2 Example Referring to Example 51.4 , we see that $\mathbb{Z}_{p}(y)$ is totally inseparable over $\mathbb{Z}_{p}\left(y^{p}\right)$, where $y$ is an indeterminate.

52.3 Theorem (Counterpart of Theorem 51.9) If $K$ is a finite extension of $E, E$ is a finite extension of $F$, and $F<E<K$, then $K$ is totally inseparable over $F$ if and only if $K$ is totally inseparable over $E$ and $E$ is totally inseparable over $F$.[^20]

Proof Since $F<E<K$, we have $[K: E]>1$ and $[E: F]>1$. Suppose $K$ is totally inseparable over $F$. Then $\{K: F\}=1$, and

$$
\{K: F\}=\{K: E\}\{E: F\}
$$

so we must have

$$
\{K: E\}=1<[K: E] \quad \text { and } \quad\{E: F\}=1<[E: F] \text {. }
$$

Thus $K$ is totally inseparable over $E$, and $E$ is totally inseparable over $F$.

Conversely, if $K$ is totally inseparable over $E$ and $E$ is totally inseparable over $F$, then

$$
\{K: F\}=\{K: E\}\{E: F\}=(1)(1)=1 \text {, }
$$

and $[K: F]>1$. Thus $K$ is totally inseparable over $F$.

Theorem 52.3 can be extended by induction, to any finite proper tower of finite extensions. The top field is a totally inseparable extension of the bottom one if and only if each field is a totally inseparable extension of the one immediately under it.

52.4 Corollary (Counterpart of the Corollary of Theorem 51.10) If $E$ is a finite extension of $F$, then $E$ is totally inseparable over $F$ if and only if each $\alpha$ in $E, \alpha \notin F$, is totally inseparable over $F$.

Proof Suppose that $E$ is totally inseparable over $F$, and let $\alpha \in E$, with $\alpha \notin F$. Then

$$
F<F(\alpha) \leq E \text {. }
$$

If $F(\alpha)=E$, we are done, by the definition of $\alpha$ totally inseparable over $F$. If $F<$ $F(\alpha)<E$, then Theorem 52.3 shows that since $E$ is totally inseparable over $F, F(\alpha)$ is totally inseparable over $F$.

Conversely, suppose that for every $\alpha \in E$, with $\alpha \notin F, \alpha$ is totally inseparable over $F$. Since $E$ is finite over $F$, there exist $\alpha_{1}, \cdots, \alpha_{n}$ such that

$$
F<F\left(\alpha_{1}\right)<F\left(\alpha_{1}, \alpha_{2}\right)<\cdots<E=F\left(\alpha_{1}, \cdots, \alpha_{n}\right) .
$$

Now since $\alpha_{i}$ is totally inseparable over $F, \alpha_{i}$ is totally inseparable over $F\left(\alpha_{1}, \cdots, \alpha_{i-1}\right)$, because $q(x)=\operatorname{irr}\left(\alpha_{i}, F\left(\alpha_{1}, \cdots, \alpha_{i-1}\right)\right)$ divides $\operatorname{irr}\left(\alpha_{i}, F\right)$ so that $\alpha_{i}$ is the only zero of $q(x)$ and is of multiplicity $>1$. Thus $F\left(\alpha_{1}, \cdots, \alpha_{i}\right)$ is totally inseparable over $F\left(\alpha_{1}, \cdots, \alpha_{i-1}\right)$, and $E$ is totally inseparable over $F$, by Theorem 52.3 , extended by induction.

Thus far we have so closely paralleled our work in Section 51 that we could have handled these ideas together.

## Separable Closures

We now come to our main reason for including this material.

52.5 Theorem Let $F$ have characteristic $p \neq 0$, and let $E$ be a finite extension of $F$. Then $\alpha \in E, \alpha \notin F$, is totally inseparable over $F$ if and only if there is some integer $t \geq 1$ such that $\alpha^{p^{t}} \in F$.

Furthermore, there is a unique extension $K$ of $F$, with $F \leq K \leq E$, such that $K$ is separable over $F$, and either $E=K$ or $E$ is totally inseparable over $K$.

Proof Let $\alpha \in E, \alpha \notin F$, be totally inseparable over $F$. Then $\operatorname{irr}(\alpha, F)$ has just one zero $\alpha$ of multiplicity $>1$, and, as shown in the proof of Theorem $51.14, \operatorname{irr}(\alpha, F)$ must be of the form

$$
x^{p^{t}}-\alpha^{p^{t}} .
$$

Hence $\alpha^{p^{t}} \in F$ for some $t \geq 1$.

Conversely, if $\alpha^{p^{t}} \in F$ for some $t \geq 1$, where $\alpha \in E$ and $\alpha \notin F$, then

$$
x^{p^{t}}-\alpha^{p^{t}}=(x-\alpha)^{p^{t}},
$$

and $\left(x^{p^{t}}-\alpha^{p^{t}}\right) \in F[x]$, showing that $\operatorname{irr}(\alpha, F)$ divides $(x-\alpha)^{p^{t}}$. Thus $\operatorname{irr}(\alpha, F)$ has $\alpha$ as its only zero and this zero is of multiplicity $>1$, so $\alpha$ is totally inseparable over $F$.

For the second part of the theorem, let $E=F\left(\alpha_{1}, \cdots, \alpha_{n}\right)$. Then if

$$
\operatorname{irr}\left(\alpha_{i}, F\right)=\prod_{j}\left(x^{p^{t_{i}}}-\alpha_{i j}^{p^{t_{i}}}\right)
$$

with $\alpha_{i 1}=\alpha_{i}$, let $\beta_{i j}=\alpha_{i j}{ }^{p_{i}}$. We have $F\left(\beta_{11}, \beta_{21}, \cdots, \beta_{n 1}\right) \leq E$, and $\beta_{i 1}$ is a zero of

$$
f_{i}(x)=\prod_{j}\left(x-\beta_{i j}\right)
$$

where $f_{i}(x) \in F[x]$. Now since raising to the power $p$ is an isomorphism $\sigma_{p}$ of $E$ onto a subfield of $E$, raising to the power of $p^{t}$ is the isomorphic mapping $\left(\sigma_{p}\right)^{t}$ of $E$ onto a subfield of $E$. Thus since the $\alpha_{i j}$ are all distinct for a fixed $i$, so are the $\beta_{i j}$ for a fixed $i$. Therefore, $\beta_{i j}$ is separable over $F$, because it is a zero of a polynomial $f_{i}(x)$ in $F[x]$ with zeros of multiplicity 1 . Then

$$
K=F\left(\beta_{11}, \beta_{21}, \cdots, \beta_{n 1}\right)
$$

is separable over $F$, by the proof of Corollary 51.10. If all $p^{t_{i}}=1$, then $K=E$. If some $p^{t_{i}} \neq 1$, then $K \neq E$, and $\alpha_{i}^{p^{t_{i}}}=\beta_{i 1}$ is in $K$, showing that each $\alpha_{i} \notin K$ is totally inseparable over $K$, by the first part of this theorem. Hence $E=K\left(\alpha_{1}, \cdots, \alpha_{n}\right)$ is totally inseparable over $K$, by the proof of Corollary 52.4 .

It follows from Corollaries 51.10 and 52.4 that the field $K$ consists of all elements $\alpha$ in $E$ that are separable over $F$. Thus $K$ is unique.

52.6 Definition The unique field $K$ of Theorem 52.5 is the separable closure of $F$ in $E$.

The preceding theorem shows the precise structure of totally inseparable extensions of a field of characteristic $p$. Such an extension can be obtained by repeatedly adjoining $p$ th roots of elements that are not already $p$ th powers.

We remark that Theorem 52.5 is true for infinite algebraic extensions $E$ of $F$. The proof of the first assertion of the theorem is valid for the case of infinite extensions also. For the second part, since $\alpha \pm \beta, \alpha \beta$, and $\alpha / \beta$, for $\beta \neq 0$, are all contained in the field $F(\alpha, \beta)$, all elements of $E$ separable over $F$ form a subfield $K$ of $E$, the separable closure of $F$ in $E$. It follows that an $\alpha \in E, \alpha \notin K$, is totally inseparable over $K$, since $\alpha$ and all coefficients of $\operatorname{irr}(\alpha, K)$ are in a finite extension of $F$, and then Theorem 52.5 can be applied.

## Section 53 Galois Theory

## Résumé

This section is perhaps the climax in elegance of the subject matter of the entire text. The Galois theory gives a beautiful interplay of group and field theory. Starting with Section 48, our work has been aimed at this goal. We shall start by recalling the main results we have developed and should have well in mind.

1. Let $F \leq E \leq \bar{F}, \alpha \in E$, and let $\beta$ be a conjugate of $\alpha$ over $F$, that is, $\operatorname{irr}(\alpha, F)$ has $\beta$ as a zero also. Then there is an isomorphism $\psi_{\alpha, \beta}$ mapping $F(\alpha)$ onto $F(\beta)$ that leaves $F$ fixed and maps $\alpha$ onto $\beta$.
2. If $F \leq E \leq \bar{F}$ and $\alpha \in E$, then an automorphism $\sigma$ of $\bar{F}$ that leaves $F$ fixed must map $\alpha$ onto some conjugate of $\alpha$ over $F$.
3. If $F \leq E$, the collection of all automorphisms of $E$ leaving $F$ fixed forms a group $G(E / F)$. For any subset $S$ of $G(E / F)$, the set of all elements of $E$ left fixed by all elements of $S$ is a field $E_{S}$. Also, $F \leq E_{G(E / F)}$.
4. A field $E, F \leq E \leq \bar{F}$, is a splitting field over $F$ if and only if every isomorphism of $E$ onto a subfield of $\bar{F}$ leaving $F$ fixed is an automorphism of $E$. If $E$ is a finite extension and a splitting field over $F$, then $|G(E / F)|=\{E: F\}$.
5. If $E$ is a finite extension of $F$, then $\{E: F\}$ divides $[E: F]$. If $E$ is also separable over $F$, then $\{E: F\}=[E: F]$. Also, $E$ is separable over $F$ if and only if $\operatorname{irr}(\alpha, F)$ has all zeros of multiplicity 1 for every $\alpha \in E$.
6. If $E$ is a finite extension of $F$ and is a separable splitting field over $F$, then $|G(E / F)|=\{E: F\}=[E: F]$.

## Normal Extensions

We are going to be interested in finite extensions $K$ of $F$ such that every isomorphism of $K$ onto a subfield of $\bar{F}$ leaving $F$ fixed is an automorphism of $K$ and such that

$$
[K: F]=\{K: F\}
$$

In view of results 4 and 5 , these are the finite extensions of $F$ that are separable splitting fields over $F$. field over $F$.

Suppose that $K$ is a finite normal extension of $F$, where $K \leq \bar{F}$, as usual. Then by result 4, every automorphism of $\bar{F}$ leaving $F$ fixed induces an automorphism of $K$. As before, we let $G(K / F)$ be the group of all automorphisms of $K$ leaving $F$ fixed. After one more result, we shall be ready to illustrate the main theorem.

53.2 Theorem Let $K$ be a finite normal extension of $F$, and let $E$ be an extension of $F$, where $F \leq E \leq$ $K \leq \bar{F}$. Then $K$ is a finite normal extension of $E$, and $G(K / E)$ is precisely the subgroup
of $G(K / F)$ consisting of all those automorphisms that leave $E$ fixed. Moreover, two automorphisms $\sigma$ and $\tau$ in $G(K / F)$ induce the same isomorphism of $E$ onto a subfield of $\bar{F}$ if and only if they are in the same left coset of $G(K / E)$ in $G(K / F)$.

Proof If $K$ is the splitting field of a set $\left\{f_{i}(x) \mid i \in I\right\}$ of polynomials in $F[x]$, then $K$ is the splitting field over $E$ of this same set of polynomials viewed as elements of $E[x]$. Theorem 51.9 shows that $K$ is separable over $E$, since $K$ is separable over $F$. Thus $K$ is a normal extension of $E$. This establishes our first contention.

Now every element of $G(K / E)$ is an automorphism of $K$ leaving $F$ fixed, since it even leaves the possibly larger field $E$ fixed. Thus $G(K / E)$ can be viewed as a subset of $G(K / F)$. Since $G(K / E)$ is a group under function composition also, we see that $G(K / E) \leq G(K / F)$.

Finally, for $\sigma$ and $\tau$ in $G(K / F), \sigma$ and $\tau$ are in the same left coset of $G(K / E)$ if and only if $\tau^{-1} \sigma \in G(K / E)$ or if and only if $\sigma=\tau \mu$ for $\mu \in G(K / E)$. But if $\sigma=\tau \mu$ for $\mu \in G(K / E)$, then for $\alpha \in E$, we have

$$
\sigma(\alpha)=(\tau \mu)(\alpha)=\tau(\mu(\alpha))=\tau(\alpha)
$$

since $\mu(\alpha)=\alpha$ for $\alpha \in E$. Conversely, if $\sigma(\alpha)=\tau(\alpha)$ for all $\alpha \in E$, then

$$
\left(\tau^{-1} \sigma\right)(\alpha)=\alpha
$$

for all $\alpha \in E$, so $\tau^{-1} \sigma$ leaves $E$ fixed, and $\mu=\tau^{-1} \sigma$ is thus in $G(K / E)$.

The preceding theorem shows that there is a one-to-one correspondence between left cosets of $G(K / E)$ in $G(K / F)$ and isomorphisms of $E$ onto a subfield of $K$ leaving $F$ fixed. Note that we cannot say that these left cosets correspond to automorphisms of $E$ over $F$, since $E$ may not be a splitting field over $F$. Of course, if $E$ is a normal extension of $F$, then these isomorphisms would be automorphisms of $E$ over $F$. We might guess that this will happen if and only if $G(K / E)$ is a normal subgroup of $G(K / F)$, and this is indeed the case. That is, the two different uses of the word normal are really closely related. Thus if $E$ is a normal extension of $F$, then the left cosets of $G(K / E)$ in $G(K / F)$ can be viewed as elements of the factor group $G(K / F) / G(K / E)$, which is then a group of automorphisms acting on $E$ and leaving $F$ fixed. We shall show that this factor group is isomorphic to $G(E / F)$.

## The Main Theorem

The Main Theorem of Galois Theory states that for a finite normal extension $K$ of a field $F$, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the subgroups of $G(K / F)$ and the intermediate fields $E$, where $F \leq E \leq K$. This correspondence associates with each intermediate field $E$ the subgroup $G(K / E)$. We can also go the other way and start with a subgroup $H$ of $G(K / F)$ and associate with $H$ its fixed field $K_{H}$. We shall illustrate this with an example, then state the theorem and discuss its proof.

53.3 Example $\quad$ Let $K=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3})$. Now $K$ is a normal extension of $\mathbb{Q}$, and Example 48.17 showed that there are four automorphisms of $K$ leaving $\mathbb{Q}$ fixed. We recall them by giving their values on the basis $\{1, \sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}, \sqrt{6}\}$ for $K$ over $\mathbb{Q}$.

$\iota$ : The identity map

$\sigma_{1}$ : Maps $\sqrt{2}$ onto $-\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{6}$ onto $-\sqrt{6}$, and leaves the others fixed

$\sigma_{2}$ : Maps $\sqrt{3}$ onto $-\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{6}$ onto $-\sqrt{6}$, and leaves the others fixed

$\sigma_{3}$ : Maps $\sqrt{2}$ onto $-\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}$ onto $-\sqrt{3}$, and leaves the others fixed

We saw that $\left\{\iota, \sigma_{1}, \sigma_{2}, \sigma_{3}\right\}$ is isomorphic to the Klein 4-group. The complete list of subgroups, with each subgroup paired off with the corresponding intermediate field that it leaves fixed, is as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\left\{\iota, \sigma_{1}, \sigma_{2}, \sigma_{3}\right\} & \leftrightarrow \mathbb{Q} \\
\left\{\iota, \sigma_{1}\right\} & \leftrightarrow \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3}) \\
\left\{\iota, \sigma_{2}\right\} & \leftrightarrow \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}) \\
\left\{\iota, \sigma_{3}\right\} & \leftrightarrow \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{6}) \\
\{\iota\} & \leftrightarrow \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3})
\end{aligned}
$$

All subgroups of the abelian group $\left\{\iota, \sigma_{1}, \sigma_{2}, \sigma_{3}\right\}$ are normal subgroups, and all the intermediate fields are normal extensions of $\mathbb{Q}$. Isn't that elegant?

Note that if one subgroup is contained in another, then the larger of the two subgroups corresponds to the smaller of the two corresponding fixed fields. The larger the subgroup, that is, the more automorphisms, the smaller the fixed field, that is, the fewer elements left fixed. In Fig. 53.4 we give the corresponding diagrams for the subgroups and intermediate fields. Note again that the groups near the top correspond to the fields near the bottom. That is, one diagram looks like the other inverted or turned upside down. Since here each diagram actually looks like itself turned upside down, this is not a good example for us
to use to illustrate this inversion principle. Turn ahead to Fig. 54.6 to see diagrams that do not look like their own inversions.

53.5 Definition If $K$ is a finite normal extension of a field $F$, then $G(K / F)$ is the Galois group of $K$ over $F$.

We shall now state the main theorem, then give another example, and finally, complete the proof of the main theorem.

53.6 Theorem

(Main Theorem of Galois Theory) Let $K$ be a finite normal extension of a field $F$, with Galois group $G(K / F)$. For a field $E$, where $F \leq E \leq K$, let $\lambda(E)$ be the subgroup of $G(K / F)$ leaving $E$ fixed. Then $\lambda$ is a one-to-one map of the set of all such intermediate fields $E$ onto the set of all subgroups of $G(K / F)$. The following properties hold for $\lambda$ :

1. $\lambda(E)=G(K / E)$.
2. $E=K_{G(K / E)}=K_{\lambda(E)}$.
3. For $H \leq G(K / F), \lambda\left(K_{H}\right)=H$.
4. $[K: E]=|\lambda(E)|$ and $[E: F]=(G(K / F): \lambda(E))$, the number of left cosets of $\lambda(E)$ in $G(K / F)$.
5. $\quad E$ is a normal extension of $F$ if and only if $\lambda(E)$ is a normal subgroup of $G(K / F)$. When $\lambda(E)$ is a normal subgroup of $G(K / F)$, then

$$
G(E / F) \simeq G(K / F) / G(K / E)
$$

6. The diagram of subgroups of $G(K / F)$ is the inverted diagram of intermediate fields of $K$ over $F$.

Observations on the Proof We have really already proved a substantial part of this theorem. Let us see just how much we have left to prove.

Property 1 is just the definition of $\lambda$ found in the statement of the theorem. For Property 2, Theorem 48.15 shows that

$$
E \leq K_{G(K / E)}
$$

Let $\alpha \in K$, where $\alpha \notin E$. Since $K$ is a normal extension of $E$, by using a conjugation isomorphism and the Isomorphism Extension Theorem, we can find an automorphism of $K$ leaving $E$ fixed and mapping $\alpha$ onto a different zero of $\operatorname{irr}(\alpha, F)$. This implies that

$$
K_{G(K / E)} \leq E
$$

so $E=K_{G(K / E)}$. This disposes of Property 2 and also tells us that $\lambda$ is one to one, for if $\lambda\left(E_{1}\right)=\lambda\left(E_{2}\right)$, then by Property 2, we have

$$
E_{1}=K_{\lambda\left(E_{1}\right)}=K_{\lambda\left(E_{2}\right)}=E_{2}
$$

Now Property 3 is going to be our main job. This amounts exactly to showing that $\lambda$ is an onto map. Of course, for $H \leq G(K / F)$, we have $H \leq \lambda\left(K_{H}\right)$, for $H$ surely is included in the set of all automorphisms leaving $K_{H}$ fixed. Here we will be using strongly our property $[K: E]=\{K: E\}$.

Property 4 follows from $[K: E]=\{K: E\},[E: F]=\{E: F\}$, and the last statement in Theorem 53.2.

We shall have to show that the two senses of the word normal correspond for Property 5.

We have already disposed of Property 6 in Example 53.3. Thus only Properties 3 and 5 remain to be proved.

The Main Theorem of Galois Theory is a strong tool in the study of zeros of polynomials. If $f(x) \in F[x]$ is such that every irreducible factor of $f(x)$ is separable over $F$, then the splitting field $K$ of $f(x)$ over $F$ is a normal extension of $F$. The Galois group $G(K / F)$ is the group of the polynomial $f(x)$ over $F$. The structure of this group may give considerable information regarding the zeros of $f(x)$. This will be strikingly illustrated in Section 56 when we achieve our final goal.

## Galois Groups over Finite Fields

Let $K$ be a finite extension of a finite field $F$. We have seen that $K$ is a separable extension of $F$ (a finite field is perfect). Suppose that the order of $F$ is $p^{r}$ and $[K: F]=n$, so the order of $K$ is $p^{r n}$. Then we have seen that $K$ is the splitting field of $x^{p^{r n}}-x$ over $F$. Hence $K$ is a normal extension of $F$.

Now one automorphism of $K$ that leaves $F$ fixed is $\sigma_{p^{r}}$, where for $\alpha \in K, \sigma_{p^{r}}(\alpha)=$ $\alpha^{p^{r}}$. Note that $\left(\sigma_{p^{r}}\right)^{i}(\alpha)=\alpha^{p^{r i}}$. Since a polynomial of degree $p^{r i}$ can have at most $p^{r i}$ zeros in a field, we see that the smallest power of $\sigma_{p^{r}}$ that could possibly leave all $p^{r n}$ elements of $K$ fixed is the $n$th power. That is, the order of the element $\sigma_{p^{r}}$ in $G(K / F)$ is at least $n$. Therefore, since $|G(K / F)|=[K: F]=n$, it must be that $G(K / F)$ is cyclic and generated by $\sigma_{p^{r}}$. We summarize these arguments in a theorem.

53.7 Theorem Let $K$ be a finite extension of degree $n$ of a finite field $F$ of $p^{r}$ elements. Then $G(K / F)$ is cyclic of order $n$, and is generated by $\sigma_{p^{r}}$, where for $\alpha \in K, \sigma_{p^{r}}(\alpha)=\alpha^{p^{r}}$.

We use this theorem to give another illustration of the Main Theorem of Galois Theory.

53.8 Example Let $F=\mathbb{Z}_{p}$, and let $K=\operatorname{GF}\left(p^{12}\right)$, so $[K: F]=12$. Then $G(K / F)$ is isomorphic to the cyclic group $\left\langle\mathbb{Z}_{12},+\right\rangle$. The diagrams for the subgroups and for the intermediate fields are given in Fig. 53.9. Again, each diagram is not only the inversion of the other, but unfortunately, also looks like the inversion of itself. Examples where the diagrams do not look like their own inversion are given in next Section 54. We describe the cyclic

subgroups of $G(K / F)=\left\langle\sigma_{p}\right\rangle$ by giving generators, for example,

$$
\left\langle\sigma_{p}{ }^{4}\right\rangle=\left\{\iota,{\sigma_{p}}^{4},{\sigma_{p}}^{8}\right\} .
$$

## Proof of the Main Theorem Completed

We saw that Properties 3 and 5 are all that remain to be proved in the Main Theorem of Galois Theory.

Proof Turning to Property 3, we must show that for $H \leq G(K / F), \lambda\left(K_{H}\right)=H$. We know that $H \leq \lambda\left(K_{H}\right) \leq G(K / F)$. Thus what we really must show is that it is impossible to have $H$ a proper subgroup of $\lambda\left(K_{H}\right)$. We shall suppose that

$$
H<\lambda\left(K_{H}\right)
$$

and shall derive a contradiction. As a finite separable extension, $K=K_{H}(\alpha)$ for some $\alpha \in K$, by Theorem 51.15. Let

$$
n=\left[K: K_{H}\right]=\left\{K: K_{H}\right\}=\left|G\left(K / K_{H}\right)\right| .
$$

Then $H<G\left(K / K_{H}\right)$ implies that $|H|<\left|G\left(K / K_{H}\right)\right|=n$. Thus we would have to have $|H|<\left[K: K_{H}\right]=n$. Let the elements of $H$ be $\sigma_{1}, \cdots, \sigma_{|H|}$, and consider the polynomial

$$
f(x)=\prod_{i=1}^{|H|}\left(x-\sigma_{i}(\alpha)\right)
$$

Then $f(x)$ is of degree $|H|<n$. Now the coefficients of each power of $x$ in $f(x)$ are symmetric expressions in the $\sigma_{i}(\alpha)$. For example, the coefficient of $x^{|H|-1}$ is $-\sigma_{1}(\alpha)-$ $\sigma_{2}(\alpha)-\cdots-\sigma_{|H|}(\alpha)$. Thus these coefficients are invariant under each isomorphism $\sigma_{i} \in H$, since if $\sigma \in H$, then

$$
\sigma \sigma_{1}, \cdots, \sigma \sigma_{|H|}
$$

is again the sequence $\sigma_{1}, \cdots, \sigma_{|H|}$, except for order, $H$ being a group. Hence $f(x)$ has coefficients in $K_{H}$, and since some $\sigma_{i}$ is $\iota$, we see that some $\sigma_{i}(\alpha)$ is $\alpha$, so $f(\alpha)=0$. Therefore, we would have

$$
\operatorname{deg}\left(\alpha, K_{H}\right) \leq|H|<n=\left[K: K_{H}\right]=\left[K_{H}(\alpha): K_{H}\right]
$$

This is impossible. Thus we have proved Property 3.

We turn to Property 5. Every extension $E$ of $F, F \leq E \leq K$, is separable over $F$, by Theorem 51.9. Thus $E$ is normal over $F$ if and only if $E$ is a splitting field over $F$. By the Isomorphism Extension Theorem, every isomorphism of $E$ onto a subfield of $\bar{F}$ leaving $F$ fixed can be extended to an automorphism of $K$, since $K$ is normal over $F$. Thus the automorphisms of $G(K / F)$ induce all possible isomorphisms of $E$ onto a subfield of $\bar{F}$ leaving $F$ fixed. By Theorem 50.3, this shows that $E$ is a splitting field over $F$, and hence is normal over $F$, if and only if for all $\sigma \in G(K / F)$ and $\alpha \in E$,

$$
\sigma(\alpha) \in E
$$

By Property 2, $E$ is the fixed field of $G(K / E)$, so $\sigma(\alpha) \in E$ if and only if for all $\tau \in G(K / E)$

$$
\tau(\sigma(\alpha))=\sigma(\alpha)
$$

## Part X Automorphisms and Galois Theory

This in turn holds if and only if

$$
\left(\sigma^{-1} \tau \sigma\right)(\alpha)=\alpha
$$

for all $\alpha \in E, \sigma \in G(K / F)$, and $\tau \in G(K / E)$. But this means that for all $\sigma \in G(K / F)$ and $\tau \in G(K / E), \sigma^{-1} \tau \sigma$ leaves every element of $E$ fixed, that is,

$$
\left(\sigma^{-1} \tau \sigma\right) \in G(K / E)
$$

This is precisely the condition that $G(K / E)$ be a normal subgroup of $G(K / F)$.

It remains for us to show that when $E$ is a normal extension of $F, G(E / F) \simeq$ $G(K / F) / G(K / E)$. For $\sigma \in G(K / F)$, let $\sigma_{E}$ be the automorphism of $E$ induced by $\sigma$ (we are assuming that $E$ is a normal extension of $F$ ). Thus $\sigma_{E} \in G(E / F)$. The map $\phi: G(K / F) \rightarrow G(E / F)$ given by

$$
\phi(\sigma)=\sigma_{E}
$$

for $\sigma \in G(K / F)$ is a homomorphism. By the Isomorphism Extension Theorem, every automorphism of $E$ leaving $F$ fixed can be extended to some automorphism of $K$; that is, it is $\tau_{E}$ for some $\tau \in G(K / F)$. Thus $\phi$ is onto $G(E / F)$. The kernel of $\phi$ is $G(K / E)$. Therefore, by the Fundamental Isomorphism Theorem, $G(E / F) \simeq G(K / F) / G(K / E)$. Furthermore, this isomorphism is a natural one.

## Theory

16. A finite normal extension $K$ of a field $F$ is abelian over $F$ if $G(K / F)$ is an abelian group. Show that if $K$ is abelian over $F$ and $E$ is a normal extension of $F$, where $F \leq E \leq K$, then $K$ is abelian over $E$ and $E$ is abelian over $F$.
17. Let $K$ be a finite normal extension of a field $F$. Prove that for every $\alpha \in K$, the norm of $\alpha$ over $F$, given by

$$

and the trace of $\alpha$ over $F$, given by

$$
\operatorname{Tr}_{K / F}(\alpha)=\sum_{\sigma \in G(K / F)} \sigma(\alpha)
$$

are elements of $F$.

18. Consider $K=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3})$. Referring to Exercise 17, compute each of the following (see Example 53.3).

23. A finite normal extension $K$ of a field $F$ is cyclic over $F$ if $G(K / F)$ is a cyclic group.

a. Show that if $K$ is cyclic over $F$ and $E$ is a normal extension of $F$, where $F \leq E \leq K$, then $E$ is cyclic over $F$ and $K$ is cyclic over $E$.

25. The join $E \vee L$ of two extension fields $E$ and $L$ of $F$ in $\bar{F}$ is the smallest subfield of $\bar{F}$ containing both $E$ and $L$. That is, $E \vee L$ is the intersection of all subfields of $\bar{F}$ containing both $E$ and $L$. Let $K$ be a finite normal extension of a field $F$, and let $E$ and $L$ be extensions of $F$ contained in $K$, as shown in Fig. 53.10. Describe $G(K /(E \vee L))$ in terms of $G(K / E)$ and $G(K / L)$.
26. With reference to the situation in Exercise 25, describe $G\{K /(E \cap L)\}$ in terms of $G(K / E)$ and $G(K / L)$.

## SECTION 54 Illustrations OF Galois Theory

## Symmetric Functions

Let $F$ be a field, and let $y_{1}, \cdots, y_{n}$ be indeterminates. There are some natural automorphisms of $F\left(y_{1}, \cdots, y_{n}\right)$ leaving $F$ fixed, namely, those defined by permutations of $\left\{y_{1}, \cdots, y_{n}\right\}$. To be more explicit, let $\sigma$ be a permutation of $\{1, \cdots, n\}$, that is, $\sigma \in S_{n}$. Then $\sigma$ gives rise to a natural map $\bar{\sigma}: F\left(y_{1}, \cdots, y_{n}\right) \rightarrow F\left(y_{1}, \cdots, y_{n}\right)$ given by

$$
\bar{\sigma}\left(\frac{f\left(y_{1}, \cdots, y_{n}\right)}{g\left(y_{1}, \cdots, y_{n}\right)}\right)=\frac{f\left(y_{\sigma(1)}, \cdots, y_{\sigma(n)}\right)}{g\left(y_{\sigma(1)}, \cdots, y_{\sigma(n)}\right)}
$$

for $f\left(y_{1}, \cdots, y_{n}\right), g\left(y_{1}, \cdots, y_{n}\right) \in F\left[y_{1}, \cdots, y_{n}\right]$, with $g\left(y_{1}, \cdots, y_{n}\right) \neq 0$. It is immediate that $\bar{\sigma}$ is an automorphism of $F\left(y_{1}, \cdots, y_{n}\right)$ leaving $F$ fixed. The elements of $F\left(y_{1}, \cdots, y_{n}\right)$ left fixed by all $\bar{\sigma}$, for all $\sigma \in S_{n}$, are those rational functions that are symmetric in the indeterminates $y_{1}, \cdots, y_{n}$.

54.1 Definition An element of the field $F\left(y_{1}, \cdots, y_{n}\right)$ is a symmetric function in $y_{1}, \cdots, y_{n}$ over $F$, if it is left fixed by all permutations of $y_{1}, \cdots, y_{n}$, in the sense just explained.

Let $\overline{S_{n}}$ be the group of all the automorphisms $\bar{\sigma}$ for $\sigma \in S_{n}$. Observe that $\overline{S_{n}}$ is naturally isomorphic to $S_{n}$. Let $K$ be the subfield of $F\left(y_{1}, \cdots, y_{n}\right)$ which is the fixed field of $\overline{S_{n}}$. Consider the polynomial

$$
f(x)=\prod_{i=1}^{n}\left(x-y_{i}\right)
$$

this polynomial $f(x) \in\left(F\left(y_{1}, \cdots, y_{n}\right)\right)[x]$ is a general polynomial of degree $n$. Let $\overline{\sigma_{x}}$ be the extension of $\bar{\sigma}$, in the natural way, to $\left(F\left(y_{1}, \cdots, y_{n}\right)\right)[x]$, where $\bar{\sigma}_{x}(x)=x$. Now $f(x)$ is left fixed by each map $\overline{\sigma_{x}}$ for $\sigma \in S_{n}$; that is,

$$
\prod_{i=1}^{n}\left(x-y_{i}\right)=\prod_{i=1}^{n}\left(x-y_{\sigma(i)}\right)
$$

Thus the coefficients of $f(x)$ are in $K$; they are elementary symmetric functions in the $y_{1}, \cdots, y_{n}$. As illustration, note that the constant term of $f(x)$ is

$$
(-1)^{n} y_{1} y_{2} \cdots y_{n}
$$

the coefficient of $x^{n-1}$ is $-\left(y_{1}+y_{2}+\cdots+y_{n}\right)$, and so on. These are symmetric functions in $y_{1}, \cdots, y_{n}$.

The first elementary symmetric function in $y_{1}, \cdots, y_{n}$ is

$$
s_{1}=y_{1}+y_{2}+\cdots+y_{n} \text {, }
$$

the second is $s_{2}=y_{1} y_{2}+y_{1} y_{3}+\cdots+y_{n-1} y_{n}$, and so on, and the $n$th is $s_{n}=y_{1} y_{2} \cdots y_{n}$.

Consider the field $E=F\left(s_{1}, \cdots, s_{n}\right)$. Of course, $E \leq K$, where $K$ is the field of all symmetric functions in $y_{1}, \cdots, y_{n}$ over $F$. But $F\left(y_{1}, \cdots, y_{n}\right)$ is a finite normal extension

## Part X Automorphisms and Galois Theory

of $E$, namely, the splitting field of

$$
f(x)=\prod_{i=1}^{n}\left(x-y_{i}\right)
$$

over $E$. Since the degree of $f(x)$ is $n$, we have at once

$$
\left[F\left(y_{1}, \cdots, y_{n}\right): E\right] \leq n !
$$

(see Exercise 13, Section 50). However, since $K$ is the fixed field of $\overline{S_{n}}$ and

$$
\left|\overline{S_{n}}\right|=\left|S_{n}\right|=n !
$$

we have also

$$
n ! \leq\left\{F\left(y_{1}, \cdots, y_{n}\right): K\right\} \leq\left[F\left(y_{1}, \cdots, y_{n}\right): K\right] .
$$

Therefore,

$$
n ! \leq\left[F\left(y_{1}, \cdots, y_{n}\right): K\right] \leq\left[F\left(y_{1}, \cdots, y_{n}\right): E\right] \leq n !
$$

so

$$
K=E .
$$

The full Galois group of $F\left(y_{1}, \cdots, y_{n}\right)$ over $E$ is therefore $\overline{S_{n}}$. The fact that $K=E$ shows that every symmetric function can be expressed as a rational function of the elementary symmetric functions $s_{1}, \cdots, s_{n}$. We summarize these results in a theorem.

54.2 Theorem Let $s_{1}, \cdots, s_{n}$ be the elementary symmetric functions in the indeterminates $y_{1}, \cdots, y_{n}$. Then every symmetric function of $y_{1}, \cdots, y_{n}$ over $F$ is a rational function of the elementary symmetric functions. Also, $F\left(y_{1}, \cdots, y_{n}\right)$ is a finite normal extension of degree $n$ ! of $F\left(s_{1}, \cdots, s_{n}\right)$, and the Galois group of this extension is naturally isomorphic to $S_{n}$.

In view of Cayley's Theorem 8.16, it can be deduced from Theorem 54.2 that any finite group can occur as a Galois group (up to isomorphism). (See Exercise 11.)

## Examples

Let us give our promised example of a finite normal extension having a Galois group whose subgroup diagram does not look like its own inversion.

54.3 Example Consider the splitting field in $\mathbb{C}$ of $x^{4}-2$ over $\mathbb{Q}$. Now $x^{4}-2$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$, by Eisenstein's criterion, with $p=2$. Let $\alpha=\sqrt[4]{2}$ be the real positive zero of $x^{4}-2$. Then the four zeros of $x^{4}-2$ in $\mathbb{C}$ are $\alpha,-\alpha, i \alpha$, and $-i \alpha$, where $i$ is the usual zero of $x^{2}+1$ in $\mathbb{C}$. The splitting field $K$ of $x^{4}-2$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ thus contains $(i \alpha) / \alpha=i$. Since $\alpha$ is a real number, $\mathbb{Q}(\alpha)<\mathbb{R}$, so $\mathbb{Q}(\alpha) \neq K$. However, since $\mathbb{Q}(\alpha, i)$ contains all zeros of $x^{4}-2$, we see that $\mathbb{Q}(\alpha, i)=K$. Letting $E=\mathbb{Q}(\alpha)$, we have the diagram in Fig. 54.4.

Now $\left\{1, \alpha, \alpha^{2}, \alpha^{3}\right\}$ is a basis for $E$ over $\mathbb{Q}$, and $\{1, i\}$ is a basis for $K$ over $E$. Thus

$$
\left\{1, \alpha, \alpha^{2}, \alpha^{3}, i, i \alpha, i \alpha^{2}, i \alpha^{3}\right\}
$$

54.4 Figure is a basis for $K$ over $\mathbb{Q}$. Since $[K: \mathbb{Q}]=8$, we must have $|G(K / \mathbb{Q})|=8$, so we need to find eight automorphisms of $K$ leaving $\mathbb{Q}$ fixed. We know that any such automorphism $\sigma$ is completely determined by its values on elements of the basis $\left\{1, \alpha, \alpha^{2}, \alpha^{3}, i, i \alpha, i \alpha^{2}\right.$, $\left.i \alpha^{3}\right\}$, and these values are in turn determined by $\sigma(\alpha)$ and $\sigma(i)$. But $\sigma(\alpha)$ must always be a conjugate of $\alpha$ over $\mathbb{Q}$, that is, one of the four zeros of $\operatorname{irr}(\alpha, \mathbb{Q})=x^{4}-2$. Likewise, $\sigma(i)$ must be a zero of $\operatorname{irr}(i, \mathbb{Q})=x^{2}+1$. Thus the four possibilities for $\sigma(\alpha)$, combined with the two possibilities for $\sigma(i)$, must give all eight automorphisms. We describe these in Table 54.5. For example, $\rho_{3}(\alpha)=-i \alpha$ and $\rho_{3}(i)=i$, while $\rho_{0}$ is the identity automorphism. Now

$$
\left(\mu_{1} \rho_{1}\right)(\alpha)=\mu_{1}\left(\rho_{1}(\alpha)\right)=\mu_{1}(i \alpha)=\mu_{1}(i) \mu_{1}(\alpha)=-i \alpha
$$

and, similarly,

$$
\left(\mu_{1} \rho_{1}\right)(i)=-i,
$$

so $\mu_{1} \rho_{1}=\delta_{2}$. A similar computation shows that

$$
\left(\rho_{1} \mu_{1}\right)(\alpha)=i \alpha \quad \text { and } \quad\left(\rho_{1} \mu_{1}\right)(i)=-i
$$

Thus $\rho_{1} \mu_{1}=\delta_{1}$, so $\rho_{1} \mu_{1} \neq \mu_{1} \rho_{1}$ and $G(K / \mathbb{Q})$ is not abelian. Therefore, $G(K / \mathbb{Q})$ must be isomorphic to one of the two nonabelian groups of order 8 described in Example 40.6. Computing from Table 54.5, we see that $\rho_{1}$ is of order $4, \mu_{1}$ is of order 2 , $\left\{\rho_{1}, \mu_{1}\right\}$ generates $G(K / \mathbb{Q})$, and $\rho_{1} \mu_{1}=\mu_{1} \rho_{1}{ }^{3}=\delta_{1}$. Thus $G(K / \mathbb{Q})$ is isomorphic to the group $G_{1}$ of Example 40.6, the octic group. We chose our notation for the elements of $G(K / \mathbb{Q})$ so that its group table would coincide with the table for the octic group in Table 8.12. The diagram of subgroups $H_{i}$ of $G(K / \mathbb{Q})$ is that given in Fig. 8.13. We repeat it here in Fig. 54.6 and also give the corresponding diagram of intermediate fields between $\mathbb{Q}$ and $K$. This finally illustrates nicely that one diagram is the inversion of the other.

The determination of the fixed fields $K_{H_{i}}$ sometimes requires a bit of ingenuity. Let's illustrate. To find $K_{H_{2}}$, we merely have to find an extension of $\mathbb{Q}$ of degree 2 left fixed by $\left\{\rho_{0}, \rho_{1}, \rho_{2}, \rho_{3}\right\}$. Since all $\rho_{j}$ leave $i$ fixed, $\mathbb{Q}(i)$ is the field we are after. To find $K_{H_{4}}$, we have to find an extension of $\mathbb{Q}$ of degree 4 left fixed by $\rho_{0}$ and $\mu_{1}$. Since $\mu_{1}$ leaves $\alpha$ fixed and $\alpha$ is a zero of $\operatorname{irr}(\alpha, \mathbb{Q})=x^{4}-2$, we see that $\mathbb{Q}(\alpha)$ is of degree 4 over $\mathbb{Q}$ and is left fixed by $\left\{\rho_{0}, \mu_{1}\right\}$. By Galois theory, it is the only such field. Here we are using strongly the one-to-one correspondence given by the Galois theory. If we find one field that fits the bill, it is the one we are after. Finding $K_{H_{7}}$ requires more ingenuity. Since $H_{7}=\left\{\rho_{0}, \delta_{1}\right\}$ is a group, for any $\beta \in K$ we see that $\rho_{0}(\beta)+\delta_{1}(\beta)$ is left fixed by $\rho_{0}$ and $\delta_{1}$. Taking $\beta=\alpha$, we see that $\rho_{0}(\alpha)+\delta_{1}(\alpha)=\alpha+i \alpha$ is left fixed by $H_{7}$. We can check and see that $\rho_{0}$ and $\delta_{1}$ are the only automorphisms leaving $\alpha+i \alpha$ fixed. Thus

by the one-to-one correspondence, we must have

$$
\mathbb{Q}(\alpha+i \alpha)=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[4]{2}+i \sqrt[4]{2})=K_{H_{7}}
$$

Suppose we wish to find $\operatorname{irr}(\alpha+i \alpha, \mathbb{Q})$. If $\gamma=\alpha+i \alpha$, then for every conjugate of $\gamma$ over $\mathbb{Q}$, there exists an automorphism of $K$ mapping $\gamma$ into that conjugate. Thus we need only compute the various different values $\sigma(\gamma)$ for $\sigma \in G(K / \mathbb{Q})$ to find the other zeros of $\operatorname{irr}(\gamma, \mathbb{Q})$. By Theorem 53.2, elements $\sigma$ of $G(K / \mathbb{Q})$ giving these different values can be found by taking a set of representatives of the left cosets of $G(K / \mathbb{Q}(\gamma))=\left\{\rho_{0}, \delta_{1}\right\}$ in $G(K / \mathbb{Q})$. A set of representatives for these left cosets is

$$
\left\{\rho_{0}, \rho_{1}, \rho_{2}, \rho_{3}\right\}
$$

The conjugates of $\gamma=\alpha+i \alpha$ are thus $\alpha+i \alpha, i \alpha-\alpha,-\alpha-i \alpha$, and $-i \alpha+\alpha$. Hence

$$
\begin{aligned}
\operatorname{irr}(\gamma, \mathbb{Q})= & {[(x-(\alpha+i \alpha))(x-(i \alpha-\alpha))] } \\
& \cdot[(x-(-\alpha-i \alpha))(x-(-i \alpha+\alpha))] \\
= & \left(x^{2}-2 i \alpha x-2 \alpha^{2}\right)\left(x^{2}+2 i \alpha x-2 \alpha^{2}\right) \\
= & x^{4}+4 \alpha^{4}=x^{4}+8
\end{aligned}
$$

We have seen examples in which the splitting field of a quartic (4th degree) polynomial over a field $F$ is an extension of $F$ of degree 8 (Example 54.3) and of degree 24 (Theorem 54.2, with $n=4$ ). The degree of an extension of a field $F$ that is a splitting field of a quartic over $F$ must always divide $4 !=24$. The splitting field of $(x-2)^{4}$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ is $\mathbb{Q}$, an extension of degree 1 , and the splitting field of $\left(x^{2}-2\right)^{2}$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ is $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})$, an extension of degree 2. Our last example will give an extension of degree 4 for the splitting field of a quartic.

54.7 Example Consider the splitting field of $x^{4}+1$ over $\mathbb{Q}$. By Theorem 23.11, we can show that $x^{4}+1$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$, by arguing that it does not factor in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$. (See Exercise 1.) The work on complex number in Section 1 shows that the zeros of $x^{4}+1$ are $(1 \pm i) / \sqrt{2}$ and $(-1 \pm i) / \sqrt{2}$. A computation shows that if

$$
\alpha=\frac{1+i}{\sqrt{2}}
$$

then

$$
\alpha^{3}=\frac{-1+i}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad \alpha^{5}=\frac{-1-i}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad \text { and } \quad \alpha^{7}=\frac{1-i}{\sqrt{2}}
$$

Thus the splitting field $K$ of $x^{4}+1$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ is $\mathbb{Q}(\alpha)$, and $[K: \mathbb{Q}]=4$. Let us compute $G(K / \mathbb{Q})$ and give the group and field diagrams. Since there exist automorphisms of $K$ mapping $\alpha$ onto each conjugate of $\alpha$, and since an automorphism $\sigma$ of $\mathbb{Q}(\alpha)$ is completely determined by $\sigma(\alpha)$, we see that the four elements of $G(K / \mathbb{Q})$ are defined by Table 54.8. Since

$$
\left(\sigma_{j} \sigma_{k}\right)(\alpha)=\sigma_{j}\left(\alpha^{k}\right)=\left(\alpha^{j}\right)^{k}=\alpha^{j k}
$$

and $\alpha^{8}=1$, we see that $G(K / \mathbb{Q})$ is isomorphic to the group $\{1,3,5,7\}$ under multiplication modulo 8 . This is the group $G_{8}$ of Theorem. 20.6. Since $\sigma_{j}^{2}=\sigma_{1}$, the identity, for all $j, G(K / \mathbb{Q})$ must be isomorphic to the Klein 4-group. The diagrams are given in Fig. 54.9.

To find $K_{\left\{\sigma_{1}, \sigma_{3}\right\}}$, it is only necessary to find an element of $K$ not in $\mathbb{Q}$ left fixed by $\left\{\sigma_{1}, \sigma_{3}\right\}$, since $\left[K_{\left\{\sigma_{1}, \sigma_{3}\right\}}: \mathbb{Q}\right]=2$. Clearly $\sigma_{1}(\alpha)+\sigma_{3}(\alpha)$ is left fixed by both $\sigma_{1}$ and $\sigma_{3}$, since $\left\{\sigma_{1}, \sigma_{3}\right\}$ is a group. We have

$$
\sigma_{1}(\alpha)+\sigma_{3}(\alpha)=\alpha+\alpha^{3}=i \sqrt{2}
$$

Similarly,

$$
\sigma_{1}(\alpha)+\sigma_{7}(\alpha)=\alpha+\alpha^{7}=\sqrt{2}
$$

is left fixed by $\left\{\sigma_{1}, \sigma_{7}\right\}$. This technique is of no use in finding $E_{\left\{\sigma_{1}, \sigma_{5}\right\}}$, for

$$
\sigma_{1}(\alpha)+\sigma_{5}(\alpha)=\alpha+\alpha^{5}=0
$$

and $0 \in \mathbb{Q}$. But by a similar argument, $\sigma_{1}(\alpha) \sigma_{5}(\alpha)$ is left fixed by both $\sigma_{1}$ and $\sigma_{5}$, and

$$
\sigma_{1}(\alpha) \sigma_{5}(\alpha)=\alpha \alpha^{5}=-i
$$

Thus $\mathbb{Q}(-i)=\mathbb{Q}(i)$ is the field we are after.

## Section 55 Cyclotomic Extensions

## The Galois Group of a Cyclotomic Extension

This section deals with extension fields of a field $F$ obtained by adjoining to $F$ some roots of unity. The case of a finite field $F$ was covered in Section 33, so we shall be primarily concerned with the case where $F$ is infinite.

55.1 Definition The splitting field of $x^{n}-1$ over $F$ is the $\boldsymbol{n}$ th cyclotomic extension of $F$.

Suppose that $F$ is any field, and consider $\left(x^{n}-1\right) \in F[x]$. By long division, as in the proof of Lemma 33.8, we see that if $\alpha$ is a zero of $x^{n}-1$ and $g(x)=\left(x^{n}-1\right) /(x-\alpha)$, then $g(\alpha)=(n \cdot 1)(1 / \alpha) \neq 0$, provided that the characteristic of $F$ does not divide $n$. Therefore, under this condition, the splitting field of $x^{n}-1$ is a separable and thus a normal extension of $F$.

## Historical Note

Carl Gauss considered cyclotomic polynomials in the final chapter of his Disquisitiones Arithmeticae of 1801 . In that chapter, he gave a constructive procedure for actually determining the roots of $\Phi_{p}(x)$ in the case where $p$ is prime. Gauss's method, which became an important example for Galois in the development of the general theory, was to solve a series of auxiliary equations, each of degree a prime factor of $p-1$, with the coefficients of each in turn being determined by the roots of the previous equation. Gauss, of course, knew that the roots of $\Phi_{p}(x)$ were all powers of one of them, say $\zeta$. He determined the auxiliary equations by taking certain sets of sums of the roots $\zeta^{j}$, which were the desired roots of these equations. For example, in the case where $p=19$ (and $p-1=18=3 \times 3 \times 2$ ), Gauss needed to find two equations of degree 3 and one of degree 2 as his auxiliaries. It turned out that the first one had the three roots, $\alpha_{1}=\zeta+\zeta^{8}+\zeta^{7}+\zeta^{18}+$ $\zeta^{11}+\zeta^{12}, \alpha_{2}=\zeta^{2}+\zeta^{16}+\zeta^{14}+\zeta^{17}+\zeta^{3}+\zeta^{5}$, and $\alpha_{3}=\zeta^{4},+\zeta^{13}+\zeta^{9}+\zeta^{15}+\zeta^{6}+\zeta^{10}$. In fact, these three values are the roots of the cubic equation $x^{3}+x^{2}-6 x-7$. Gauss then found a second cubic equation, with coefficients involving the $\alpha$ 's, whose roots were sums of two of the powers of $\zeta$, and finally a quadratic equation, whose coefficients involved the roots of the previous equation, which had $\zeta$ as one of its roots. Gauss then asserted (without a complete proof) that each auxiliary equation can in turn be reduced to an equation of the form $x^{m}-A$, which clearly can be solved by radicals. That is, he showed that the solvability of the Galois group in this case, the cyclic group of order $p-1$, implied that the cyclotomic equation was solvable in terms of radicals. (See Section 56.)

Assume from now on that this is the case, and let $K$ be the splitting field of $x^{n}-1$ over $F$. Then $x^{n}-1$ has $n$ distinct zeros in $K$, and by Corollary 23.6, these form a cyclic group of order $n$ under the field multiplication. We saw in Corollary 6.16 that a cyclic group of order $n$ has $\varphi(n)$ generators, where $\varphi$ is the Euler phi-function introduced prior to Theorem 20.8. For our situation here, these $\varphi(n)$ generators are exactly the primitive $n$th roots of unity.

55.2 Definition The polynomial

$$
\Phi_{n}(x)=\prod_{i=1}^{\varphi(n)}\left(x-\alpha_{i}\right)
$$

where the $\alpha_{i}$ are the primitive $n$th roots of unity in $\bar{F}$, is the $\boldsymbol{n}$ th cyclotomic polynomial over $F$.

Since an automorphism of the Galois group $G(K / F)$ must permute the primitive $n$th roots of unity, we see that $\Phi_{n}(x)$ is left fixed under every element of $G(K / F)$ regarded as extended in the natural way to $K[x]$. Thus $\Phi_{n}(x) \in F[x]$. In particular, for $F=\mathbb{Q}, \Phi_{n}(x) \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$, and $\Phi_{n}(x)$ is a divisor of $x^{n}-1$. Thus over $\mathbb{Q}$, we must actually have $\Phi_{n}(x) \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$, by Theorem 23.11. We have seen that $\Phi_{p}(x)$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$, in Corollary 23.17. While $\Phi_{n}(x)$ need not be irreducible in the case of the fields $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$, it can be shown that over $\mathbb{Q}, \Phi_{n}(x)$ is irreducible.

Let us now limit our discussion to characteristic 0 , in particular to subfields of the complex numbers. Let $i$ be the usual complex zero of $x^{2}+1$. Our work with complex numbers in Section 1 shows that

$$
\left(\cos \frac{2 \pi}{n}+i \sin \frac{2 \pi}{n}\right)^{n}=\cos 2 \pi+i \sin 2 \pi=1,
$$

so $\cos (2 \pi / n)+i \sin (2 \pi / n)$ is an $n$th root of unity. The least integer $m$ such that $(\cos (2 \pi / n)+i \sin (2 \pi / n))^{m}=1$ is $n$. Thus $\cos (2 \pi / n)+i \sin (2 \pi / n)$ is a primitive $\mathrm{n}$ th root of unity, a zero of

$$
\Phi_{n}(x) \in \mathbb{Q}[x] .
$$

55.3 Example A primitive 8th root of unity in $\mathbb{C}$ is

$$
\begin{aligned}
\zeta & =\cos \frac{2 \pi}{8}+i \sin \frac{2 \pi}{8} \\
& =\cos \frac{\pi}{4}+i \sin \frac{\pi}{4} \\
& =\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}+i \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}=\frac{1+i}{\sqrt{2}}
\end{aligned}
$$

By the theory of cyclic groups, in particular by Corollary 6.16 all the primitive 8th roots of unity in $\mathbb{Q}$ are $\zeta, \zeta^{3}, \zeta^{5}$, and $\zeta^{7}$, so

$$
\Phi_{8}(x)=(x-\zeta)\left(x-\zeta^{3}\right)\left(x-\zeta^{5}\right)\left(x-\zeta^{7}\right)
$$

We can compute, directly from this expression, $\Phi_{8}(x)=x^{4}+1$ (see Exercise 1). Compare this with Example 54.7.

Let us still restrict our work to $F=\mathbb{Q}$, and let us assume, without proof, that $\Phi_{n}(x)$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$. Let

$$
\zeta=\cos \frac{2 \pi}{n}+i \sin \frac{2 \pi}{n}
$$

## Part X Automorphisms and Galois Theory

so that $\zeta$ is a primitive $n$th root of unity. Note that $\zeta$ is a generator of the cyclic multiplicative group of order $n$ consisting of all $n$th roots of unity. All the primitive $n$th roots of unity, that is, all the generators of this group, are of the form $\zeta^{m}$ for $1 \leq m<n$ and $m$ relatively prime to $n$. The field $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta)$ is the whole splitting field of $x^{n}-1$ over $\mathbb{Q}$. Let $K=\mathbb{Q}(\zeta)$. If $\zeta^{m}$ is another primitive $n$th root of unity, then since $\zeta$ and $\zeta^{m}$ are conjugate over $\mathbb{Q}$, there is an automorphism $\tau_{m}$ in $G(K / \mathbb{Q})$ mapping $\zeta$ onto $\zeta^{m}$. Let $\tau_{r}$ be the similar automorphism in $G(K / \mathbb{Q})$ corresponding to a primitive $n$th root of unity $\zeta^{r}$. Then

$$
\left(\tau_{m} \tau_{r}\right)(\zeta)=\tau_{m}\left(\zeta^{r}\right)=\left(\tau_{m}(\zeta)\right)^{r}=\left(\zeta^{m}\right)^{r}=\zeta^{r m}
$$

This shows that the Galois group $G(K / \mathbb{Q})$ is isomorphic to the group $G_{n}$ of Theorem 20.6 consisting of elements of $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ relatively prime to $n$ under multiplication modulo $n$. This group has $\varphi(n)$ elements and is abelian.

Special cases of this material have appeared several times in the text and exercises. For example, $\alpha$ of Example 54.7 is a primitive 8th root of unity, and we made arguments in that example identical to those given here. We summarize these results in a theorem.

55.4 Theorem The Galois group of the $n$th cyclotomic extension of $\mathbb{Q}$ has $\varphi(n)$ elements and is isomorphic to the group consisting of the positive integers less than $n$ and relatively prime to $n$ under multiplication modulo $n$.

55.5 Example Example 54.7 illustrates this theorem, for it is easy to see that the splitting field of $x^{4}+1$ is the same as the splitting field of $x^{8}-1$ over $\mathbb{Q}$. This follows from the fact that $\Phi_{8}(x)=x^{4}+1$ (see Example 55.3 and Exercise 1).

55.6 Corollary The Galois group of the $p$ th cyclotomic extension of $\mathbb{Q}$ for a prime $p$ is cyclic of order $p-1$.

Proof By Theorem 55.4, the Galois group of the pth cyclotomic extension of $\mathbb{Q}$ has $\varphi(p)=$ $p-1$ elements, and is isomorphic to the group of positive integers less than $p$ and relatively prime to $p$ under multiplication modulo $p$. This is exactly the multiplicative group $\left\langle\mathbb{Z}_{p}{ }^{*}, \cdot\right\rangle$ of nonzero elements of the field $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ under field multiplication. By Corollary 23.6, this group is cyclic.

## Constructible Polygons

We conclude with an application determining which regular $n$-gons are constructible with a compass and a straightedge. We saw in Section 32 that the regular $n$-gon is constructible if and only if $\cos (2 \pi / n)$ is a constructible real number. Now let

$$
\zeta=\cos \frac{2 \pi}{n}+i \sin \frac{2 \pi}{n}
$$

Then

$$
\frac{1}{\zeta}=\cos \frac{2 \pi}{n}-i \sin \frac{2 \pi}{n}
$$

for

$$
\left(\cos \frac{2 \pi}{n}+i \sin \frac{2 \pi}{n}\right)\left(\cos \frac{2 \pi}{n}-i \sin \frac{2 \pi}{n}\right)=\cos ^{2} \frac{2 \pi}{n}+\sin ^{2} \frac{2 \pi}{n}=1
$$

But then

$$
\zeta+\frac{1}{\zeta}=2 \cos \frac{2 \pi}{n}
$$

Thus Corollary 32.8 shows that the regular $n$-gon is constructible only if $\zeta+1 / \zeta$ generates an extension of $\mathbb{Q}$ of degree a power of 2 .

If $K$ is the splitting field of $x^{n}-1$ over $\mathbb{Q}$, then $[K: \mathbb{Q}]=\varphi(n)$, by Theorem 55.4. If $\sigma \in G(K / \mathbb{Q})$ and $\sigma(\zeta)=\zeta^{r}$, then

$$
\begin{aligned}
\sigma\left(\zeta+\frac{1}{\zeta}\right) & =\zeta^{r}+\frac{1}{\zeta^{r}} \\
& =\left(\cos \frac{2 \pi r}{n}+i \sin \frac{2 \pi r}{n}\right)+\left(\cos \frac{2 \pi r}{n}-i \sin \frac{2 \pi r}{n}\right) \\
& =2 \cos \frac{2 \pi r}{n}
\end{aligned}
$$

But for $1<r<n$, we have $2 \cos (2 \pi r / n)=2 \cos (2 \pi / n)$ only in the case that $r=n-1$. Thus the only elements of $G(K / \mathbb{Q})$ carrying $\zeta+1 / \zeta$ onto itself are the identity automorphism and the automorphism $\tau$, with $\tau(\zeta)=\zeta^{n-1}=1 / \zeta$. This shows that the subgroup of $G(K / \mathbb{Q})$ leaving $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta+1 / \zeta)$ fixed is of order 2 , so by Galois theory,

$$
\left[\mathbb{Q}\left(\zeta+\frac{1}{\zeta}\right): \mathbb{Q}\right]=\frac{\varphi(n)}{2}
$$

Hence the regular $n$-gon is constructible only if $\varphi(n) / 2$, and therefore also $\varphi(n)$, is a power of 2.

It can be shown by elementary arguments in number theory that if

$$
n=2^{v} p_{1}{ }^{s_{1}} \cdots p_{t}{ }^{s_{t}}
$$

where the $p_{i}$ are the distinct odd primes dividing $n$, then

$$
\varphi(n)=2^{\nu-1} p_{1}{ }^{s_{1}-1} \cdots p_{t}^{s_{t}-1}\left(p_{1}-1\right) \cdots\left(p_{t}-1\right) .
$$

If $\varphi(n)$ is to be a power of 2, then every odd prime dividing $n$ must appear only to the first power and must be one more than a power of 2 . Thus we must have each

$$
p_{i}=2^{m}+1
$$

for some $m$. Since -1 is a zero of $x^{q}+1$ for $q$ an odd prime, $x+1$ divides $x^{q}+1$ for $q$ an odd prime. Thus, if $m=q u$, where $q$ is an odd prime, then $2^{m}+1=\left(2^{u}\right)^{q}+1$ is divisible by $2^{u}+1$. Therefore, for $p_{i}=2^{m}+1$ to be prime, it must be that $m$ is divisible by 2 only, so $p_{i}$ has to have the form

$$
p_{i}=2^{\left(2^{k}\right)}+1 \text {, }
$$

a Fermat prime. Fermat conjectured that these numbers $2^{\left(2^{k}\right)}+1$ were prime for all nonnegative integers $k$. Euler showed that while $k=0,1,2,3$, and 4 give the primes 3 , $5,17,257$, and 65537 , for $k=5$, the integer $2^{\left(2^{s}\right)}+1$ is divisible by 641 . It has been shown that for $5 \leq k \leq 19$, all the numbers $2^{\left(2^{k}\right)}+1$ are composite. The case $k=20$ is still unsolved as far as we know. For at least 60 values of $k$ greater than 20, including $k=9448$, it has been shown that $2^{2^{k}}+1$ is composite. It is unknown whether the number of Fermat primes is finite or infinite.

We have thus shown that the only regular $n$-gons that might be constructible are those where the odd primes dividing $n$ are Fermat primes whose squares do not divide $n$. In particular, the only regular $p$-gons that might be constructible for $p$ a prime greater than 2 are those where $p$ is a Fermat prime.

55.7 Example The regular 7-gon is not constructible, since 7 is not a Fermat prime. Similarly, the regular 18 -gon is not constructible, for while 3 is a Fermat prime, its square divides 18.

It is a fact that we now demonstrate that all these regular $n$-gons that are candidates for being constructible are indeed actually constructible. Let $\zeta$ again be the primitive $n$th root of unity $\cos (2 \pi / n)+i \sin (2 \pi / n)$. We saw above that

$$
2 \cos \frac{2 \pi}{n}=\zeta+\frac{1}{\zeta}
$$

and that

$$
\left[\mathbb{Q}\left(\zeta+\frac{1}{\zeta}\right): \mathbb{Q}\right]=\frac{\varphi(n)}{2}
$$

Suppose now that $\varphi(n)$ is a power $2^{s}$ of 2 . Let $E$ be $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta+1 / \zeta)$. We saw above that $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta+1 / \zeta)$ is the subfield of $K=\mathbb{Q}(\zeta)$ left fixed by $H_{1}=\{\iota, \tau\}$, where $\iota$ is the identity element of $G(K / \mathbb{Q})$ and $\tau(\zeta)=1 / \zeta$. By Sylow theory, there exist additional subgroups $H_{j}$ of order $2^{j}$ of $G(\mathbb{Q}(\zeta) / \mathbb{Q})$ for $j=0,2,3, \cdots, s$ such that

$$
\{\iota\}=H_{0}<H_{1}<\cdots<H_{s}=G(\mathbb{Q}(\zeta) / \mathbb{Q}) .
$$

By Galois theory,

$$
\mathbb{Q}=K_{H_{s}}<K_{H_{s-1}}<\cdots<K_{H_{1}}=\mathbb{Q}\left(\zeta+\frac{1}{\zeta}\right)
$$

and $\left[K_{H_{j-1}}: K_{H}\right]=2$. Note that $(\zeta+1 / \zeta) \in \mathbb{R}$, so $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta+1 / \zeta)<\mathbb{R}$. If $K_{H_{j-1}}=K_{H_{j}}\left(\alpha_{j}\right)$, then $\alpha_{j}$ is a zero of some $\left(a_{j} x^{2}+b_{j} x+c_{j}\right) \in K_{H_{j}}[x]$. By the familiar "quadratic formula," we have

$$
K_{H_{j-1}}=K_{H_{j}}\left(\sqrt{b_{j}^{2}-4 a_{j} c_{j}}\right)
$$

Since we saw in Section 33 that construction of square roots of positive constructible numbers can be achieved by a straightedge and a compass, we see that every element in
$\mathbb{Q}(\zeta+1 / \zeta)$, in particular $\cos (2 \pi / n)$, is constructible. Hence the regular $n$-gons where $\varphi(n)$ is a power of 2 are constructible.

We summarize our work under this heading in a theorem.

55.8 Theorem The regular $n$-gon is constructible with a compass and a straightedge if and only if all the odd primes dividing $n$ are Fermat primes whose squares do not divide $n$.

55.9 Example The regular 60 -gon is constructible, since $60=\left(2^{2}\right)(3)(5)$ and 3 and 5 are both Fermat primes.

## SECTION 56 InsOLVABILITY OF THE QUINTIC

## The Problem

We are familiar with the fact that a quadratic polynomial $f(x)=a x^{2}+b x+c, a \neq 0$, with real coefficients has $\left(-b \pm \sqrt{b^{2}-4 a c}\right) / 2 a$ as zeros in $\mathbb{C}$. Actually, this is true for $f(x) \in F[x]$, where $F$ is any field of characteristic $\neq 2$ and the zeros are in $\bar{F}$. Exercise 4 asks us to show this. Thus, for example, $\left(x^{2}+2 x+3\right) \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$ has its zeros in $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-2})$. You may wonder whether the zeros of a cubic polynomial over $\mathbb{Q}$ can also always be expressed in terms of radicals. The answer is yes, and indeed, even the zeros of a polynomial of degree 4 over $\mathbb{Q}$ can be expressed in terms of radicals. After mathematicians had tried for years to find the "radical formula" for zeros of a 5th degree polynomial, it was a triumph when Abel proved that a quintic need not be solvable by radicals. Our first job will be to describe precisely what this means. A large amount of the algebra we have developed is used in the forthcoming discussion.

## Extensions by Radicals

56.1 Definition An extension $K$ of a field $F$ is an extension of $F$ by radicals if there are elements $\alpha_{1}, \cdots, \alpha_{r} \in K$ and positive integers $n_{1}, \cdots, n_{r}$ such that $K=F\left(\alpha_{1}, \cdots, \alpha_{r}\right), \alpha_{1}^{n_{1}} \in F$ and $\alpha_{i}^{n_{i}} \in F\left(\alpha_{1}, \cdots, \alpha_{i-1}\right)$ for $1<i \leq r$. A polynomial $f(x) \in F[x]$ is solvable by radicals over $F$ if the splitting field $E$ of $f(x)$ over $F$ is contained in an extension of $F$ by radicals.

A polynomial $f(x) \in F(x)$ is thus solvable by radicals over $F$ if we can obtain every zero of $f(x)$ by using a finite sequence of the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and taking $n_{i}$ th roots, starting with elements of $F$. Now to say that the quintic is not solvable in the classic case, that is, characteristic 0 , is not to say that no quintic is solvable, as the following example shows.

## Historical Note

$\mathrm{T}$ he first publication of a formula for solving cubic equations in terms of radicals was in 1545 in the Ars Magna of Girolamo Cardano, although the initial discovery of the method is in part also due to Scipione del Ferro and Niccolo Tartaglia. Cardano's student, Lodovico Ferrari, discovered a method for solving quartic equations by radicals, which also appeared in Cardano's work.

After many mathematicians had attempted to solve quintics by similar methods, it was JosephLouis Lagrange who in 1770 first attempted a detailed analysis of the general principles underlying the solutions for polynomials of degree 3 and 4 , and showed why these methods fail for those of higher degree. His basic insight was that in the former cases there were rational functions of the roots that took on two and three values, respectively, under all possible permutations of the roots, hence these rational functions could be written as roots of equations of degree less than that of the original. No such functions were evident in equations of higher degree.

The first mathematician to claim to have a proof of the insolvability of the quintic equation was Paolo Ruffini (1765-1822) in his algebra text of 1799. His proof was along the lines suggested by Lagrange, in that he in effect determined all of the subgroups of $S_{5}$ and showed how these subgroups acted on rational functions of the roots of the equation. Unfortunately, there were several gaps in his various published versions of the proof. It was Niels Henrik Abel who, in 1824 and 1826, published a complete proof, closing all of Ruffini's gaps and finally settling this centuries-old question.

56.2 Example The polynomial $x^{5}-1$ is solvable by radicals over $\mathbb{Q}$. The splitting field $K$ of $x^{5}-1$ is generated over $\mathbb{Q}$ by a primitive 5 th root $\zeta$ of unity. Then $\zeta^{5}=1$, and $K=\mathbb{Q}(\zeta)$. Similarly, $x^{5}-2$ is solvable by radicals over $\mathbb{Q}$, for its splitting field over $\mathbb{Q}$ is generated by $\sqrt[5]{2}$ and $\zeta$, where $\sqrt[5]{2}$ is the real zero of $x^{5}-2$.

To say that the quintic is insolvable in the classic case means that there exists some polynomial of degree 5 with real coefficients that is not solvable by radicals. We shall show this. We assume throughout this section that all fields mentioned have characteristic 0 .

The outline of the argument is as follows, and it is worthwhile to try to remember it.

1. We shall show that a polynomial $f(x) \in F[x]$ is solvable by radicals over $F$ (if and) only if its splitting field $E$ over $F$ has a solvable Galois group. Recall that a solvable group is one having a composition series with abelian quotients. While this theorem goes both ways, we shall not prove the "if" part.
2. We shall show that there is a subfield $F$ of the real numbers and a polynomial $f(x) \in F[x]$ of degree 5 with a splitting field $E$ over $F$ such that $G(E / F) \simeq S_{5}$, the symmetric group on 5 letters. Recall that a composition series for $S_{5}$ is $\{\iota\}<A_{5}<S_{5}$. Since $A_{5}$ is not abelian, we will be done.

The following lemma does most of our work for Step 1.

56.3 Lemma Let $F$ be a field of characteristic 0 , and let $a \in F$. If $K$ is the splitting field of $x^{n}-a$ over $F$, then $G(K / F)$ is a solvable group.

Proof Suppose first that $F$ contains all the $n$th roots of unity. By Corollary 23.6 the $n$th roots of unity form a cyclic subgroup of $\left\langle F^{*}, \cdot\right\rangle$. Let $\zeta$ be a generator of the subgroup. (Actually, the generators are exactly the primitive $n$th roots of unity.) Then the $n$th roots of unity are

$$
1, \zeta, \zeta^{2}, \cdots, \zeta^{n-1}
$$

If $\beta \in \bar{F}$ is a zero of $\left(x^{n}-a\right) \in F[x]$, then all zeros of $x^{n}-a$ are

$$
\beta, \zeta \beta, \zeta^{2} \beta, \cdots, \zeta^{n-1} \beta
$$

Since $K=F(\beta)$, an automorphism $\sigma$ in $G(K / F)$ is determined by the value $\sigma(\beta)$ of the automorphism $\sigma$ on $\beta$. Now if $\sigma(\beta)=\zeta^{i} \beta$ and $\tau(\beta)=\zeta^{j} \beta$, where $\tau \in G(K / F)$, then

$$
(\tau \sigma)(\beta)=\tau(\sigma(\beta))=\tau\left(\zeta^{i} \beta\right)=\zeta^{i} \tau(\beta)=\zeta^{i} \zeta^{j} \beta,
$$

since $\zeta^{i} \in F$. Similarly,

$$
(\sigma \tau)(\beta)=\zeta^{j} \zeta^{i} \beta
$$

Thus $\sigma \tau=\tau \sigma$, and $G(K / F)$ is abelian and therefore solvable.

Now suppose that $F$ does not contain a primitive $n$th root of unity. Let $\zeta$ be a generator of the cyclic group of $n$th roots of unity under multiplication in $\bar{F}$. Let $\beta$ again be a zero of $x^{n}-a$. Since $\beta$ and $\zeta \beta$ are both in the splitting field $K$ of $x^{n}-a, \zeta=(\zeta \beta) / \beta$ is in $K$. Let $F^{\prime}=F(\zeta)$, so we have $F<F^{\prime} \leq K$. Now $F^{\prime}$ is a normal extension of $F$, since $F^{\prime}$ is the splitting field of $x^{n}-1$. Since $F^{\prime}=F(\zeta)$, an automorphism $\eta$ in $G\left(F^{\prime} / F\right)$ is determined by $\eta(\zeta)$, and we must have $\eta(\zeta)=\zeta^{i}$ for some $i$, since all zeros of $x^{n}-1$ are powers of $\zeta$. If $\mu(\zeta)=\zeta^{j}$ for $\mu \in G\left(F^{\prime} / F\right)$, then

$$
(\mu \eta)(\zeta)=\mu(\eta(\zeta))=\mu\left(\zeta^{i}\right)=\mu(\zeta)^{i}=\left(\zeta^{j}\right)^{i}=\zeta^{i j}
$$

and, similarly,

$$
(\eta \mu)(\zeta)=\zeta^{i j}
$$

Thus $G\left(F^{\prime} / F\right)$ is abelian. By the Main Theorem of Galois Theory,

$$
\{\iota\} \leq G\left(K / F^{\prime}\right) \leq G(K / F)
$$

is a normal series and hence a subnormal series of groups. The first part of the proof shows that $G\left(K / F^{\prime}\right)$ is abelian, and Galois theory tells us that $G(K / F) / G\left(K / F^{\prime}\right)$ is isomorphic to $G\left(F^{\prime} / F\right)$, which is abelian. Exercise 6 shows that if a group has a subnormal series of subgroups with abelian quotient groups, then any refinement of this series also has abelian quotient groups. Thus a composition series of $G(K / F)$ must have abelian quotient groups, so $G(K / F)$ is solvable.

The following theorem will complete Part 1 of our program.

56.4 Theorem Let $F$ be a field of characteristic zero, and let $F \leq E \leq K \leq \bar{F}$, where $E$ is a normal extension of $F$ and $K$ is an extension of $F$ by radicals. Then $G(E / F)$ is a solvable group.

Proof We first show that $K$ is contained in a finite normal extension $L$ of $F$ by radicals and that the group $G(L / F)$ is solvable. Since $K$ is an extension by radicals, $K=F\left(\alpha_{1}, \cdots, \alpha_{r}\right)$
where $\alpha_{i}^{n_{i}} \in F\left(\alpha_{1}, \cdots, \alpha_{i-1}\right)$ for $1<i \leq r$ and $\alpha_{1}^{n_{1}} \in F$. To form $L$, we first form the splitting field $L_{1}$ of $f_{1}(x)=x^{n_{1}}-\alpha_{1}^{n_{1}}$ over $F$. Then $L_{1}$ is a normal extension of $F$, and Lemma 56.3 shows that $G\left(L_{1} / F\right)$ is a solvable group. Now $\alpha_{2}^{n_{2}} \in L_{1}$ and we form the polynomial

$$
f_{2}(x)=\prod_{\sigma \in G\left(L_{1} / F\right)}\left[\left(x^{n_{2}}-\sigma\left(\alpha_{2}\right)^{n_{2}}\right]\right.
$$

Since this polynomial is invariant under action by any $\sigma$ in $G\left(L_{1} / F\right)$, we see that $f_{2}(x) \in F[x]$. We let $L_{2}$ be the splitting field of $f_{2}(x)$ over $L_{1}$. Then $L_{2}$ is a splitting field over $F$ also and is a normal extension of $F$ by radicals. We can form $L_{2}$ from $L_{1}$ via repeated steps as in Lemma 56.3, passing to a splitting field of $x^{n_{2}}-\sigma\left(\alpha_{2}\right)^{n_{2}}$ at each step. By Lemma 56.3 and Exercise 7, we see that the Galois group over $F$ of each new extension thus formed continues to be solvable. We continue this process of forming splitting fields over $F$ in this manner: At stage $i$, we form the splitting field of the polynomial

$$
f_{i}(x)=\prod_{\alpha \in G\left(L_{i-1} / F\right)}\left[\left(x^{n_{i}}-\sigma\left(\alpha_{i}\right)^{n_{i}}\right]\right.
$$

over $L_{i-1}$. We finally obtain a field $L=L_{r}$ that is a normal extension of $F$ by radicals, and we see that $G(L / F)$ is a solvable group. We see from construction that $K \leq L$.

To conclude, we need only note that by Theorem 53.6, we have $G(E / F) \simeq G(L / F)$ / $G(L / E)$. Thus $G(E / F)$ is a factor group, and hence a homomorphic image, of $G(L / F)$. Since $G(L / F)$ is solvable, Exercise 29 of Section 35 shows that $G(E / F)$ is solvable.

## The Insolvability of the Quintic

It remains for us to show that there is a subfield $F$ of the real numbers and a polynomial $f(x) \in F[x]$ of degree 5 such that the splitting field $E$ of $f(x)$ over $F$ has a Galois group isomorphic to $S_{5}$.

Let $y_{1} \in \mathbb{R}$ be transcendental over $\mathbb{Q}, y_{2} \in \mathbb{R}$ be transcendental over $\mathbb{Q}\left(y_{1}\right)$, and so on, until we get $y_{5} \in \mathbb{R}$ transcendental over $\mathbb{Q}\left(y_{1}, \cdots, y_{4}\right)$. It can be shown by a counting argument that such transcendental real numbers exist. Transcendentals found in this fashion are independent transcendental elements over $\mathbb{Q}$. Let $E=\mathbb{Q}\left(y_{1}, \cdots, y_{5}\right)$, and let

$$
f(x)=\prod_{i=1}^{5}\left(x-y_{i}\right)
$$

Thus $f(x) \in E[x]$. Now the coefficients of $f(x)$ are, except possibly for sign, among the elementary symmetry functions in the $y_{i}$, namely

$$
\begin{aligned}
s_{1}= & y_{1}+y_{2}+\cdots+y_{5}, \\
s_{2}= & y_{1} y_{2}+y_{1} y_{3}+y_{1} y_{4}+y_{1} y_{5}+y_{2} y_{3} \\
& \quad+y_{2} y_{4}+y_{2} y_{5}+y_{3} y_{4}+y_{3} y_{5}+y_{4} y_{5}, \\
& \vdots \\
s_{5}= & y_{1} y_{2} y_{3} y_{4} y_{5} .
\end{aligned}
$$

56.5 Figure

The coefficient of $x^{i}$ in $f(x)$ is $\pm s_{5-i}$. Let $F=\mathbb{Q}\left(s_{1}, s_{2}, \cdots, s_{5}\right)$; then $f(x) \in F[x]$ (see Fig. 56.5). Then $E$ is the splitting field over $F$ of $f(x)$. Since the $y_{i}$ behave as indeterminates over $\mathbb{Q}$, for each $\sigma \in S_{5}$, the symmetric group on five letters, $\sigma$ induces an automorphism $\bar{\sigma}$ of $E$ defined by $\bar{\sigma}(a)=a$ for $a \in \mathbb{Q}$ and $\bar{\sigma}\left(y_{i}\right)=y_{\sigma(i)}$. Since $\Pi_{i=1}^{5}\left(x-y_{i}\right)$ is the same polynomial as $\Pi_{i=1}^{5}\left(x-y_{\sigma(i)}\right)$, we have

$$
\bar{\sigma}\left(s_{i}\right)=s_{i}
$$

for each $i$, so $\bar{\sigma}$ leaves $F$ fixed, and hence $\bar{\sigma} \in G(E / F)$. Now $S_{5}$ has order 5 !, so

$$
|G(E / F)| \geq 5 ! \text {. }
$$

Since the splitting field of a polynomial of degree 5 over $F$ has degree at most 5 ! over $F$, we see that

$$
|G(E / F)| \leq 5 \text { !. }
$$

Thus $|G(E / F)|=5$ !, and the automorphisms $\bar{\sigma}$ make up the full Galois group $G(E / F)$. Therefore, $G(E / F) \simeq S_{5}$, so $G(E / F)$ is not solvable. This completes our outline, and we summarize in a theorem.

56.6 Theorem Let $y_{1}, \cdots, y_{5}$ be independent transcendental real numbers over $\mathbb{Q}$. The polynomial

$$
f(x)=\prod_{i=1}^{5}\left(x-y_{i}\right)
$$

is not solvable by radicals over $F=\mathbb{Q}\left(s_{1}, \cdots, s_{5}\right)$, where $s_{i}$ is the $i$ th elementary symmetric function in $y_{1}, \cdots, y_{5}$.

It is evident that a generalization of these arguments shows that (final goal) a polynomial of degree $n$ need not be solvable by radicals for $n \geq 5$.

In conclusion, we comment that there exist polynomials of degree 5 in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$ that are not solvable by radicals over $\mathbb{Q}$. A demonstration of this is left to the exercises (see Exercise 8).

## EXERCISES 56

## Theory

4. Let $F$ be a field, and let $f(x)=a x^{2}+b x+c$ be in $F[x]$, where $a \neq 0$. Show that if the characteristic of $F$ is not 2, the splitting field of $f(x)$ over $F$ is $F\left(\sqrt{b^{2}-4 a c}\right)$. [Hint: Complete the square, just as in your high school work, to derive the "quadratic formula."]
5. Show that if $F$ is a field of characteristic different from 2 and

$$
f(x)=a x^{4}+b x^{2}+c
$$

where $a \neq 0$, then $f(x)$ is solvable by radicals over $F$.

6. Show that for a finite group, every refinement of a subnormal series with abelian quotients also has abelian quotients, thus completing the proof of Lemma 56.3. [Hint: Use Theorem 34.7.]
7. Show that for a finite group, a subnormal series with solvable quotient groups can be refined to a composition series with abelian quotients, thus completing the proof of Theorem 56.4. [Hint: Use Theorem 34.7.]
8. This exercise exhibits a polynomial of degree 5 in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$ that is not solvable by radicals over $\mathbb{Q}$.

a. Show that if a subgroup $H$ of $S_{5}$ contains a cycle of length 5 and a transposition $\tau$, then $H=S_{5}$. [Hint: Show that $H$ contains every transposition of $S_{5}$ and apply Corollary 9.12. See Exercise 39, Section 9.]

b. Show that if $f(x)$ is an irreducible polynomial in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$ of degree 5 having exactly two complex and three real zeros in $\mathbb{C}$, then the group of $f(x)$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ is isomorphic to $S_{5}$. [Hint: Use Sylow theory to show that the group has an element of order 5 . Use the fact that $f(x)$ has exactly two complex zeros to show that the group has an element of order 2 . Then apply part (a).]

c. The polynomial $f(x)=2 x^{5}-5 x^{4}+5$ is irreducible in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$, by the Eisenstein criterion, with $p=5$. Use the techniques of calculus to find relative maxima and minima and to "graph the polynomial function $f$ " well enough to see that $f(x)$ must have exactly three real zeros in $\mathbb{C}$. Conclude from part (b) and Theorem 56.4 that $f(x)$ is not solvable by radicals over $\mathbb{Q}$.

## Appendix: Matrix Algebra

We give a brief summary of matrix algebra here. Matrices appear in examples in some chapters of the text and also are involved in several exercises.

A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers. For example, the array

$$
\left[\begin{array}{rrr}
2 & -1 & 4 \\
3 & 1 & 2
\end{array}\right]
$$

is a matrix having two rows and three columns. A matrix having $m$ rows and $n$ columns is an $m \times n$ matrix, so Matrix (1) is a $2 \times 3$ matrix. If $m=n$, the matrix is square. Entries in a matrix may be any type of number-integer, rational, real, or complex. We let $M_{m \times n}(\mathbb{R})$ be the set of all $m \times n$ matrices with real number entries. If $m=n$, the notation is abbreviated to $M_{n}(\mathbb{R})$. We can similarly consider $M_{n}(\mathbb{Z}), M_{2 \times 3}(\mathbb{C})$, etc.

Two matrices having the same number $m$ of rows and the same number $n$ of columns can be added in the obvious way: we add entries in corresponding positions.

A1 Example $\quad$ In $M_{2 \times 3}(\mathbb{Z})$, we have

$$
\left[\begin{array}{rrr}
2 & -1 & 4 \\
3 & 1 & 2
\end{array}\right]+\left[\begin{array}{rrr}
1 & 0 & -3 \\
2 & -7 & 1
\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{lll}
3 & -1 & 1 \\
5 & -6 & 3
\end{array}\right]
$$

We will use uppercase letters to denote matrices. If $A, B$, and $C$ are $m \times n$ matrices, it is easily seen that $A+B=B+A$ and that $A+(B+C)=(A+B)+C$.

Matrix multiplication, $A B$, is defined only if the number of columns of $A$ is equal to the number of rows of $B$. That is, if $A$ is an $m \times n$ matrix, then $B$ must be an $n \times s$ matrix for some integer $s$. We start by defining as follows the product $A B$ where $A$ is a
$1 \times n$ matrix and $B$ is an $n \times 1$ matrix:

$$
A B=\left[\begin{array}{llll}
a_{1} & a_{2} & \cdots & a_{n}
\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
b_{1} \\
b_{2} \\
\vdots \\
b_{n}
\end{array}\right]=a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}
$$

Note that the result is a number. (We shall not distinguish between a number and the $1 \times 1$ matrix having that number as its sole entry.) You may recognize this product as the dot product of vectors. Matrices having only one row or only one column are row vectors or column vectors, respectively.

A2 Example We find that

$$
\left[\begin{array}{lll}
3 & -7 & 2
\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{l}
1 \\
4 \\
5
\end{array}\right]=(3)(1)+(-7)(4)+(2)(5)=-15
$$

Let $A$ be an $m \times n$ matrix and let $B$ be an $n \times s$ matrix. Note that the number $n$ of entries in each row of $A$ is the same as the number $n$ of entries in each column of $B$. The product $C=A B$ is an $m \times s$ matrix. The entry in the $i$ th row and $j$ th column of $A B$ is the product of the $i$ th row of $A$ times the $j$ th column of $B$ as defined by Eq. (2) and illustrated in Example A2.

A3 Example Compute

$$
A B=\left[\begin{array}{rrr}
2 & -1 & 3 \\
1 & 4 & 6
\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{rrrr}
3 & 1 & 2 & 1 \\
1 & 4 & 1 & -1 \\
-1 & 0 & 2 & 1
\end{array}\right]
$$

Solution Note that $A$ is $2 \times 3$ and $B$ is $3 \times 4$. Thus $A B$ will be $2 \times 4$. The entry in its second row and third column is

$$
(2 \mathrm{nd} \operatorname{row} A)(3 \operatorname{rd} \operatorname{column} B)=\left[\begin{array}{lll}
1 & 4 & 6
\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{l}
2 \\
1 \\
2
\end{array}\right]=2+4+12=18
$$

Computing all eight entries of $A B$ in this fashion, we obtain

$$
A B=\left[\begin{array}{rrrr}
2 & -2 & 9 & 6 \\
1 & 17 & 18 & 3
\end{array}\right]
$$

A4 Example The product

$$
\left[\begin{array}{rrr}
2 & -1 & 3 \\
1 & 4 & 6
\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{ll}
2 & 1 \\
5 & 4
\end{array}\right]
$$

is not defined, since the number of entries in a row of the first matrix is not equal to the number of entries in a column of the second matrix.

For square matrices of the same size, both addition and multiplication are always defined. Exercise 10 asks us to illustrate the following fact.

Matrix multiplication is not commutative.

That is, $A B$ need not equal $B A$ even when both products are defined, as for $A, B \in$ $M_{2}(\mathbb{Z})$. It can be shown that $A(B C)=(A B) C$ and $A(B+C)=A B+A C$ whenever all these expressions are defined.

We let $I_{n}$ be the $n \times n$ matrix with entries 1 along the diagonal from the upper-left corner to the lower-right corner, and entries 0 elsewhere. For example,

$$
I_{3}=\left[\begin{array}{lll}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{array}\right]
$$

It is easy to see that if $A$ is any $n \times s$ matrix and $B$ is any $r \times n$ matrix, then $I_{n} A=A$ and $B I_{n}=B$. That is, the matrix $I_{n}$ acts much as the number 1 does for multiplication when multiplication by $I_{n}$ is defined.

Let $A$ be an $n \times n$ matrix and consider a matrix equation of the form $A X=B$, where $A$ and $B$ are known but $X$ is unknown. If we can find an $n \times n$ matrix $A^{-1}$ such that $A^{-1} A=A A^{-1}=I_{n}$, then we can conclude that

$$
A^{-1}(A X)=A^{-1} B, \quad\left(A^{-1} A\right) X=A^{-1} B, \quad I_{n} X=A^{-1} B, \quad X=A^{-1} B
$$

and we have found the desired matrix $X$. Such a matrix $A^{-1}$ acts like the reciprocal of a number: $A^{-1} A=I_{n}$ and $(1 / r) r=1$. This is the reason for the notation $A^{-1}$.

If $A^{-1}$ exists, the square matrix $A$ is invertible and $A^{-1}$ is the inverse of $A$. If $A^{-1}$ does not exist, then $A$ is said to be singular. It can be shown that if there exists a matrix $A^{-1}$ such that $A^{-1} A=I_{n}$, then $A A^{-1}=I_{n}$ also, and furthermore, there is only one matrix $A^{-1}$ having this property.

## A5 Example Let

$$
A=\left[\begin{array}{ll}
2 & 9 \\
1 & 4
\end{array}\right]
$$

We can check that

$$
\left[\begin{array}{rr}
-4 & 9 \\
1 & -2
\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{ll}
2 & 9 \\
1 & 4
\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{ll}
2 & 9 \\
1 & 4
\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{rr}
-4 & 9 \\
1 & -2
\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{ll}
1 & 0 \\
0 & 1
\end{array}\right]
$$

Thus,

$$
A^{-1}=\left[\begin{array}{rr}
-4 & 9 \\
1 & -2
\end{array}\right]
$$

We leave the problems of determining the existence of $A^{-1}$ and its computation to a course in linear algebra.

Associated with each square $n \times n$ matrix $A$ is a number called the determinant of $A$ and denoted by $\operatorname{det}(A)$. This number can be computed as sums and differences of certain products of the numbers that appear in the matrix $A$. For example, the
determinant of the $2 \times 2$ matrix $\left[\begin{array}{ll}a & b \\ c & d\end{array}\right]$ is $a d-b c$. Note that an $n \times 1$ matrix with real number entries can be viewed as giving coordinates of a point in $n$-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. Multiplication of such a single column matrix on the left by a real $n \times n$ matrix $A$ produces another such single column matrix corresponding to another point in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. This multiplication on the left by $A$ thus gives a map of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ into itself. It can be shown that a piece of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ of volume $V$ is mapped by this multiplication by $A$ into a piece of volume $|\operatorname{det}(A)| \cdot V$. This is one of the reasons that determinants are important.

The following properties of determinants for $n \times n$ matrices $A$ and $B$ are of interest in this text:

1. $\operatorname{det}\left(I_{n}\right)=1$
2. $\operatorname{det}(A B)=\operatorname{det}(A) \operatorname{det}(B))$
3. $\operatorname{det}(A) \neq 0$ if and only if $A$ is an invertible matrix
4. If $B$ is obtained from $A$ by interchanging two rows (or two columns) of $A$, then $\operatorname{det}(B)=-\operatorname{det}(A)$
5. If every entry of $A$ is zero above the main diagonal from the upper left corner to the lower right corner, then $\operatorname{det}(A)$ is the product of the entries on this diagonal. The same is true if all entries below the main diagonal are zero.

[^0]:    *We should mention another terminology, used by the disciples of N. Bourbaki, in case you encounter it elsewhere. In Bourbaki's terminology, a one-to-one map is an injection, an onto map is a surjection, and a map that is both one to one and onto is a bijection.

[^1]:    ${ }^{\dagger}$ Most students of abstract algebra have studied linear algebra and are familiar with matrices and matrix operations. For the benefit of those students, examples involving matrices are often given. The reader who is not familiar with matrices can either skip all references to them or turn to the Appendix at the back of the text, where there is a short summary.

[^4]:    $\dagger$ We may find occasion to distinguish between the terms minimal and smallest as applied to subsets of a set $S$ that have some property. A subset $H$ of $S$ is minimal with respect to the property if $H$ has the property, and no subset $K \subset H, K \neq H$, has the property. If $H$ has the property and $H \subseteq K$ for every subset $K$ with the property, then $H$ is the smallest subset with the property. There may be many minimal subsets, but there can be only one smallest subset. To illustrate, $\{e, a\},\{e, b\}$, and $\{e, c\}$ are all minimal nontrivial subgroups of the group $V$. (See Fig. 5.12.) However, $V$ contains no smallest nontrivial subgroup.
