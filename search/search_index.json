To show that (2) \\(\\Rightarrow\\) (3), assume that \\(X\\) is limit point compact. Given a sequence \\(\\left(x_{n}\\right)\\) of points of \\(X\\), consider the set \\(A=\\left\\{x_{n} \\mid n \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{+}\\right\\}\\).

This is the hardest part of the proof.</p> <p>First, we show that if \\(X\\) is sequentially compact, then the Lebesgue number lemma holds for \\(X\\). (This would follow from compactness, but compactness is what we are trying to prove!) Let \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) be an open covering of \\(X\\). We assume that there is no \\(\\delta&gt;0\\) such that each set of diameter less than \\(\\delta\\) has an element of \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) containing it, and derive a contradiction.</p> <p>Our assumption implies in particular that for each positive integer \\(n\\), there exists a set of diameter less than \\(1 / n\\) that is not contained in any element of \\(\\mathcal{A}\\); let \\(C_{n}\\) be such a set. Choose a point \\(x_{n} \\in C_{n}\\), for each \\(n\\). By hypothesis, some subsequence \\(\\left(x_{n_{i}}\\right)\\) of the sequence \\(\\left(x_{n}\\right)\\) converges, say to the point \\(a\\). Now \\(a\\) belongs to some element \\(A\\) of the collection \\(\\mathcal{A}\\); because \\(A\\) is open, we may choose an \\(\\epsilon&gt;0\\) such that \\(B(a, \\epsilon) \\subset A\\). If \\(i\\) is large enough that \\(1 / n_{i}&lt;\\epsilon / 2\\), then the set \\(C_{n_{i}}\\) lies in the \\(\\epsilon / 2\\)-neighborhood of \\(x_{n_{i}}\\); if \\(i\\) is also chosen large enough that \\(d\\left(x_{n_{i}}, a\\right)&lt;\\epsilon / 2\\), then \\(C_{n_{i}}\\) lies in the \\(\\epsilon\\)-neighborhood of \\(a\\).

Once again, we proceed by contradiction. Assume that there exists an \\(\\epsilon&gt;0\\) such that \\(X\\) cannot be covered by finitely many \\(\\epsilon\\)-balls. Construct a sequence of points \\(x_{n}\\) of \\(X\\) as follows: First, choose \\(x_{1}\\) to be any point of \\(X\\). Noting that the ball \\(B\\left(x_{1}, \\epsilon\\right)\\) is not all of \\(X\\) (otherwise \\(X\\) could be covered by a single \\(\\epsilon\\)-ball), choose \\(x_{2}\\) to be a point of \\(X\\) not in \\(B\\left(x_{1}, \\epsilon\\right)\\). In general, given \\(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{n}\\), choose \\(x_{n+1}\\) to be a point not in the union</p> \\[ B\\left(x_{1}, \\epsilon\\right) \\cup \\cdots \\cup B\\left(x_{n}, \\epsilon\\right) \\] <p>using the fact that these balls do not cover \\(X\\). Note that by construction \\(d\\left(x_{n+1}, x_{i}\\right) \\geq\\) \\(\\epsilon\\) for \\(i=1, \\ldots, n\\). Therefore, the sequence \\(\\left(x_{n}\\right)\\) can have no convergent subsequence; in fact, any ball of radius \\(\\epsilon / 2\\) can contain \\(x_{n}\\) for at most one value of \\(n\\).</p> <p>Finally, we show that if \\(X\\) is sequentially compact, then \\(X\\) is compact. Let \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) be an open covering of \\(X\\). Because \\(X\\) is sequentially compact, the open covering \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) has a Lebesgue number \\(\\delta\\). Let \\(\\epsilon=\\delta / 3\\); use sequential compactness of \\(X\\) to find a finite covering of \\(X\\) by open \\(\\epsilon\\)-balls. Each of these balls has diameter at most \\(2 \\delta / 3\\), so it lies in an element of \\(\\mathcal{A}\\).

Topologize \\(Y\\) by defining the collection of open sets of \\(Y\\) to consist of (1) all sets \\(U\\) that are open in \\(X\\), and (2) all sets of the form \\(Y-C\\), where \\(C\\) is a compact subspace of \\(X\\).</p> <p>We need to check that this collection is, in fact, a topology on \\(Y\\). The empty set is a set of type (1), and the space \\(Y\\) is a set of type (2).

To prove the second half, note that if \\(B-\\left\\{a_{0}\\right\\}=\\varnothing\\), there is a bijection of \\(B\\) with the set \\(\\{1\\}\\); while if \\(B-\\left\\{a_{0}\\right\\} \\neq \\varnothing\\), we can apply Lemma 6.1, along with (2), to conclude that there is a bijection of \\(B\\) with \\(\\{1, \\ldots, p+1\\}\\). In either case, there is a bijection of \\(B\\) with \\(\\{1, \\ldots, m\\}\\) for some \\(m&lt;n+1\\), as desired. The induction principle now shows that the theorem is true for all \\(n \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{+}\\).</p> <p>Corollary 6.3</p> <p>If \\(A\\) is finite, there is no bijection of \\(A\\) with a proper subset of itself.</p> <p>Proof</p> <p>Assume that \\(B\\) is a proper subset of \\(A\\) and that \\(f: A \\rightarrow B\\) is a bijection. By assumption, there is a bijection \\(g: A \\rightarrow\\{1, \\ldots, n\\}\\) for some \\(n\\). The composite \\(g \\circ f^{-1}\\) is then a bijection of \\(B\\) with \\(\\{1, \\ldots, n\\}\\). This contradicts Theorem 6.2.</p> <p>Corollary 6.4</p> <p>\\(\\mathbb{Z}_{+}\\) is not finite.</p> <p>Proof</p> <p>The function \\(f: \\mathbb{Z}_{+} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}_{+}-\\{1\\}\\) defined by \\(f(n)=n+1\\) is a bijection of \\(\\mathbb{Z}_{+}\\)with a proper subset of itself. If \\(\\mathbb{Z}_{+}\\) is finite, it is a contradiction to Corollary 6.3, so \\(\\mathbb{Z}_{+}\\) is not finite.</p> <p>Corollary 6.5</p> <p>The cardinality of a finite set \\(A\\) is uniquely determined by \\(A\\).</p> <p>Proof</p> <p>Let \\(m&lt;n\\).

If \\(B\\) is a proper subset of \\(A\\), then the cardinality of \\(B\\) is less than the cardinality of \\(A\\).</p> <p>Corollary 6.7</p> <p>Let \\(B\\) be a nonempty set. Then the following are equivalent:</p> <ol> <li> <p>\\(B\\) is finite.</p> </li> <li> <p>There is a surjective function from a section of the positive integers onto \\(B\\).</p> </li> <li> <p>There is an injective function from \\(B\\) into a section of the positive integers.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Proof</p> <p>(1) \\(\\Longrightarrow\\) (2). Since \\(B\\) is nonempty, there is, for some \\(n\\), a bijective function \\(f:\\{1, \\ldots, n\\} \\rightarrow B\\).</p> <p>(2) \\(\\Longrightarrow\\) (3).

If \\(g: B \\rightarrow\\{1, \\ldots, n\\}\\) is injective, then changing the range of \\(g\\) gives a bijection of \\(B\\) with a subset of \\(\\{1, \\ldots, n\\}\\). It follows from the Corollary 6.6 that \\(B\\) is finite.</p> <p>Corollary 6.8</p> <p>Finite unions and finite cartesian products of finite sets are finite.</p> <p>Proof</p> <p>We first show that if \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are finite, so is \\(A \\cup B\\). The result is trivial if \\(A\\) or \\(B\\) is empty. Otherwise, there are bijections \\(f:\\{1, \\ldots, m\\} \\rightarrow A\\) and \\(g\\) : \\(\\{1, \\ldots, n\\} \\rightarrow B\\) for some choice of \\(m\\) and \\(n\\). Define a function \\(h:\\{1, \\ldots, m+\\) \\(n\\} \\rightarrow A \\cup B\\) by setting \\(h(i)=f(i)\\) for \\(i=1,2, \\ldots, m\\) and \\(h(i)=g(i-m)\\) for \\(i=m+1, \\ldots, m+n\\). It is easy to check that \\(h\\) is surjective, and from Corollary 6.7 it follows that \\(A \\cup B\\) is finite.</p> <p>Now we show by induction that finiteness of the sets \\(A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{n}\\) implies finiteness of their union. This result is trivial for \\(n=1\\). Assuming it true for \\(n-1\\), we note that \\(A_{1} \\cup \\cdots \\cup A_{n}\\) is the union of the two finite sets \\(A_{1} \\cup \\cdots \\cup A_{n-1}\\) and \\(A_{n}\\), so the result of the preceding paragraph applies.</p> <p>Now we show that the cartesian product of two finite sets \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) is finite. Given \\(a \\in A\\), the set \\(\\{a\\} \\times B\\) is finite, being in bijective correspondence with \\(B\\). The set \\(A \\times B\\) is the union of these sets; since there are only finitely many of them, \\(A \\times B\\) is a finite union of finite sets and thus finite.</p> <p>To prove that the product \\(A_{1} \\times \\cdots \\times A_{n}\\) is finite if each \\(A_{i}\\) is finite, one proceeds by induction.</p>"}]}
