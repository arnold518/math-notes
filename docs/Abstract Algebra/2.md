# § 2. Binary Operations

!!! definition "Definition 2.1 : Binary Operation"
    A **binary operation** $*$ on a set $S$ is a function mapping $S \times S$ into $S$.  
    For each $(a, b) \in S \times S$, we denote $∗((a, b))$ by $a * b$.

!!! definition "Definition 2.4 : Closed Under / Induced Operation"
    Let $*$ be a binary operation on $S$, and let $H \subset S$.  
    $H$ is **closed under** $*$ if for all $a, b \in H$, $a * b \in H$.  
    The binary operation on $H$ given by restricting $∗$ to $H$ is the **induced operation** of $∗$ on $H$.

!!! definition "Definition 2.11 : Commutativity"
    A binary operation $∗$ on a set $S$ is **commutative** if $\forall a, b \in S$, $a ∗ b = b ∗ a$.

!!! definition "Definition 2.12 : Associativity"
    A binary operation $∗$ on a set $S$ is **associative** if $\forall a, b, c \in S$, $(a ∗ b) ∗ c = a ∗ (b ∗ c)$.

!!! theorem "Theorem 2.13 : Associativity of Composition"
    Let $S$ be a set and let $f, g, h$ be functions mapping $S$ into $S$.  
    $f \circ (g \circ h) = (f \circ g) \circ h$

    !!! proof
        $(f \circ (g \circ h))(x) = f((g \circ h)(x)) = f(g(h(x)))$  
        $((f \circ g) \circ h)(x) = (f \circ g)(h(x)) = f(g(h(x)))$  
        $\therefore f \circ (g \circ h) = (f \circ g) \circ h$

## Tables

!!! definition "Definition 2.14 : Tables"
    We can draw a table, where the elements of the set are listed across the top as heads of columns and at the left side as heads of rows.
    The table is filled in the following way.
    <center>
    ($i$th entry on the left) $*$ ($j$th entry on the top) = (entry in the $i$th row and $j$th column)
    </center>
