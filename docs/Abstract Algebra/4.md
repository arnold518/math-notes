# ยง 4. Groups

## Definition and Examples

!!! definition "Definition 4.1 : Group"
    A **group** $\langle G, *\rangle$ is a set $G$, closed under a binary operation $*$, such that the following axioms are satisfied:  

    1. $\mathscr{G}_1$ : $\forall a, b, c, \in G$, $(a * b) * c = a * (b * c)$. (**associativity of** $*$)
    2. $\mathscr{G}_2$ : $\exists \ e \in G$, $\forall x \in G$, $e*x=x*e=x$. (**identity element** $e$ for $*$)
    3. $\mathscr{G}_3$ : $\forall a \in G$, $\exists \ a' \in G$ s.t. $a * a' = a' * a = e$. (**inverse** $a'$ of $a$)

!!! definition "Definition 4.3 : Abelian Group"
    A group $G$ is **abelian** if its binary operation is commutative.

!!! example "Example 4.13 : General Linear Group of Degree $n$"
    The group of invertible $n \times n$ matrices under matrix multiplication is a group.
    It is the **general linear group of degree** $n$, and is denoted by $GL(n, \mathbb{R})$.  
    A matrix $A$ in $GL(n, \mathbb{R})$ gives rise to an invertible linear transformation $T: \mathbb{R}^{n} \rightarrow$ $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, defined by $T(\mathbf{x})=A \mathbf{x}$, and conversely, every invertible linear transformation of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ into itself is defined in this fashion by some matrix in $GL(n, \mathbb{R})$.
    Also, matrix multiplication corresponds to composition of linear transformations.  
    Thus, all invertible linear transformations of $\mathbb{R}^n$ into itself form a group under function composition.
    It is denoted by $GL(\mathbb{R}^n)$, and $GL(n, \mathbb{R}) \simeq GL(\mathbb{R}^n)$

## Elementary Properties of Groups

!!! theorem "Theorem 4.15 : Left and Right Cancellation Laws"
    If $G$ is a group with binary operation $*$, the **left and right cancellation laws** hold in $G$.  
    $\forall \ a, b, c \in G$  
    $a*b=a*c \Rightarrow b=c$  
    $b*a=c*a \Rightarrow b=c$

    !!! proof
        If $a*b=a*c$, $\exists \ a'$, and $a'*(a*b)=a'*(a*c)$.  
        By the associative law, $(a'*a)*b=(a'*a)*c$.  
        $e*b=e*c$, and $\therefore b=c$.
        Same holds for right cancellation law.

!!! theorem "Theorem 4.16 : Uniqueness of Solutions of Linear Equation"
    If $G$ is a group with binary operation $*$, $\forall a, b \in G$,  
    linear equations $a*x=b$, $y*a=b$ have unique solutions $x, y \in G$.
    
    !!! proof
        $x=a'*b$ is a solution for $a*x=b$, so solution exists.
        Also, $y=b*a'$ is a solution for $y*a=b$.  
        Let $x_1$, $x_2$ be two solutions that $a*x_1=b$, $a*x_2=b$.
        By **Theorem 4.15**, $a*x_1 = a*x_2 \Rightarrow x_1=x_2$, so the solution is unique.
        Same holds for $y$.

!!! theorem "Theorem 4.17 : Uniqueness of Identity Element and Inverse"
    In a group $G$ with binary operation $*$,  
    There is only one element $e \in G$ s.t. $\forall x \in G$, $e*x=x*e=x$.  
    For each $a \in G$, there is only one element $a' \in G$ s.t. $a*a'=a'*a=e$.  
    The identity element and inverse of each element are unique in a group.
    
    !!! proof
        **Theorem 3.13** shows that identity element is unique, without any group axioms.  
        Suppose $a \in G$ has inverse $a'$, $a''$ s.t. $a*a'=a'*a=e$, $a*a''=a''*a=e$.  
        Since $a*a'=a*a''=e$, by **Theorem 4.15** $a'=a''$, and inverse is unique.

!!! theorem "Corollary 4.18"
    If $G$ is a group, $\forall \ a, b \in G$, $(a*b)'=b'*a'$.

## Binary Algebraic Structures with Weaker Axioms

!!! definition "Definition 4.19 : Semigroup / Monoid"
    **Semigroup** is a set with an associative binary operation.  
    **Monoid** is a semigroup that has an identity element.

!!! theorem "Theorem 4.20 : One Sided Definition"
    **One sided defined** Group satisfies,  

    1. $\forall a, b, c, \in G$, $(a * b) * c = a * (b * c)$.  
    2. $\exists \ e_L \in G$, $\forall x \in G$, $e_L*x=x$.  
    3. $\forall a \in G$, $\exists \ a_L' \in G$ s.t. $a_L' * a = e_L$.  
    
    One sided defined group also satisfies group axioms.

    !!! proof
        $x*e_L=(e_L*x)*e_L=(((x_L')_L'*x_L')*x)*e_L=((x_L')_L'*(x_L'*x))*e_L$  
        $=((x_L')_L'*e_L)*e_L=(x_L')_L'*(x_L'*x)=((x_L')_L'*x_L')*x=e_L*x=x$  
        $\therefore e_L=e$.  
        $a*a_L'=((a_L')_L'*a_L')*a*a_L'=(a_L')_L'*(a_L'*a)*a_L'=(a_L')_L'*a_L'=e_L$  
        $\therefore a_L'=a'$.  

## Finite Groups and Group Tables

!!! theorem "Theorem 4.21 : Property of Group Table"
    1. The first colum and row of the table must contain itself.
    $a*e=e*a=a$
    2. Each element $a$ of the group must appear once and only once in each row and each column of the table.
    **Theorem 4.16**
