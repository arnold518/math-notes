# ยง 19. The Product Topology

!!! definition "Definition 19.1 : J-Tuple / Coordinate"
    Let $J$ be an index set.
    Given a set $X$, we define a **$J$-tuple** of elements of $X$ to be a function $\mathbf{x}: J \rightarrow X$.
    If $\alpha$ is an element of $J$, we often denote the value of $\mathbf{x}$ at $\alpha$ by $x_{\alpha}$ rather than $\mathbf{x}(\alpha)$; we call it the $\alpha$ th **coordinate** of $\mathbf{x}$.
    And we often denote the function $\mathbf{x}$ itself by the symbol

    $$
    \left(x_{\alpha}\right)_{\alpha \in J},
    $$

    which is as close as we can come to a "tuple notation" for an arbitrary index set $J$.
    We denote the set of all $J$-tuples of elements of $X$ by $X^J$.

!!! definition "Definition 19.2 : Cartesian Product"
    Let $\left\{A_{\alpha}\right\}_{\alpha \in J}$ be an indexed family of sets; let $X=\bigcup_{\alpha \in J} A_{\alpha}$.
    The **cartesian product** of this indexed family, denoted by

    $$
    \prod_{\alpha \in J} A_{\alpha}
    $$

    is defined to be the set of all $J$-tuples $\left(x_{\alpha}\right)_{\alpha \in J}$ of elements of $X$ such that $x_{\alpha} \in A_{\alpha}$ for each $\alpha \in J$.
    That is, it is the set of all functions

    $$
    \mathbf{x}: J \rightarrow \bigcup_{\alpha \in J} A_{\alpha}
    $$

    such that $\mathbf{x}(\alpha) \in A_{\alpha}$ for each $\alpha \in J$.

    Occasionally we denote the product simply by $\prod A_{\alpha}$, and its general element by $\left(x_{\alpha}\right)$, if the index set is understood.

!!! definition "Definition 19.3 : Box Topology"
    Let $\left\{X_{\alpha}\right\}_{\alpha \in J}$ be an indexed family of topological spaces.
    Let us take as a basis for a topology on the product space

    $$
    \prod_{\alpha \in J} X_{\alpha}
    $$

    the collection of all sets of the form

    $$
    \prod_{\alpha \in J} U_{\alpha}
    $$

    where $U_{\alpha}$ is open in $X_{\alpha}$, for each $\alpha \in J$. The topology generated by this basis is called the box topology.

!!! definition "Definition 19.4 : Projection Mapping"
    Let

    $$
    \pi_{\beta}: \prod_{\alpha \in J} X_{\alpha} \rightarrow X_{\beta}
    $$

    be the function assigning to each element of the product space its $\beta$ th coordinate,

    $$
    \pi_{\beta}\left(\left(x_{\alpha}\right)_{\alpha \in J}\right)=x_{\beta}
    $$

    it is called the **projection mapping** associated with the index $\beta$.

!!! definition "Definition 19.5 : Product Topology / Product Space"
    Let $S_{\beta}$ denote the collection

    $$
    \mathcal{S}_{\beta}=\left\{\pi_{\beta}^{-1}\left(U_{\beta}\right) \mid U_{\beta} \text { open in } X_{\beta}\right\}
    $$

    and let $S$ denote the union of these collections,

    $$
    \mathcal{S}=\bigcup_{\beta \in J} s_{\beta}
    $$

    The topology generated by the subbasis $S$ is called the **product topology**.
    In this topology $\prod_{\alpha \in J} X_{\alpha}$ is called a **product space**.

!!! theorem "Theorem 19.1 : Comparison of the Box and Product Topologies"
    The box topology on $\prod X_{\alpha}$ has as basis all sets of the form $\prod U_{\alpha}$, where $U_{\alpha}$ is open in $X_{\alpha}$ for each $\alpha$.
    The product topology on $\prod X_{\alpha}$ has as basis all sets of the form $\prod U_{\alpha}$, where $U_{\alpha}$ is open in $X_{\alpha}$ for each $\alpha$ and $U_{\alpha}$ equals $X_{\alpha}$ except for finitely many values of $\alpha$.

    !!! proof
        We consider the basis $\mathcal{B}$ that $S$ generates. The collection $\mathcal{B}$ consists of all finite intersections of elements of $\mathcal{S}$. If we intersect elements belonging to the same one of the sets $S_{\beta}$, we do not get anything new, because

        $$
        \pi_{\beta}^{-1}\left(U_{\beta}\right) \cap \pi_{\beta}^{-1}\left(V_{\beta}\right)=\pi_{\beta}^{-1}\left(U_{\beta} \cap V_{\beta}\right) ;
        $$

        the intersection of two elements of $S_{\beta}$, or of finitely many such elements, is again an element of $S_{\beta}$. We get something new only when we intersect elements from different sets $S_{\beta}$. The typical element of the basis $\mathcal{B}$ can thus be described as follows: Let $\beta_{1}$, $\ldots, \beta_{n}$ be a finite set of distinct indices from the index set $J$, and let $U_{\beta_{i}}$ be an open set in $X_{\beta_{i}}$ for $i=1, \ldots, n$. Then

        $$
        B=\pi_{\beta_{1}}^{-1}\left(U_{\beta_{1}}\right) \cap \pi_{\beta_{2}}^{-1}\left(U_{\beta_{2}}\right) \cap \cdots \cap \pi_{\beta_{n}}^{-1}\left(U_{\beta_{n}}\right)
        $$

        is the typical element of $\mathcal{B}$.

        Now a point $\mathbf{x}=\left(x_{\alpha}\right)$ is in $B$ if and only if its $\beta_{1}$ th coordinate is in $U_{\beta_{1}}$, its $\beta_{2}$ th coordinate is in $U_{\beta_{2}}$, and so on. There is no restriction whatever on the $\alpha$ th coordinate of $\mathbf{x}$ if $\alpha$ is not one of the indices $\beta_{1}, \ldots, \beta_{n}$. As a result, we can write $B$ as the product

        $$
        B=\prod_{\alpha \in J} U_{\alpha}
        $$

        where $U_{\alpha}$ denotes the entire space $X_{\alpha}$ if $\alpha \neq \beta_{1}, \ldots, \beta_{n}$.

!!! theorem "Theorem 19.1.1"
    For finite products $\prod_{\alpha=1}^{n} X_{\alpha}$ the box topology and product topology are precisely the same.

    The box topology is in general finer than the product topology.

    Whenever we consider the product $\prod X_{\alpha}$, we shall assume it is given the product topology unless we specifically state otherwise.

!!! theorem "Theorem 19.2"
    Suppose the topology on each space $X_{\alpha}$ is given by a basis $\mathcal{B}_{\alpha}$.
    The collection of all sets of the form

    $$
    \prod_{\alpha \in J} B_{\alpha}
    $$

    where $B_{\alpha} \in \mathcal{B}_{\alpha}$ for each $\alpha$, will serve as a basis for the box topology on $\prod_{\alpha \in J} X_{\alpha}$.

    The collection of all sets of the same form, where $B_{\alpha} \in \mathcal{B}_{\alpha}$ for finitely many indices $\alpha$ and $B_{\alpha}=X_{\alpha}$ for all the remaining indices, will serve as a basis for the product topology $\prod_{\alpha \in J} X_{\alpha}$.

!!! theorem "Theorem 19.3"
    Let $A_{\alpha}$ be a subspace of $X_{\alpha}$, for each $\alpha \in J$.
    Then $\prod A_{\alpha}$ is a subspace of $\prod X_{\alpha}$ if both products are given the box topology, or if both products are given the product topology.

!!! theorem "Theorem 19.4"
    If each space $X_{\alpha}$ is Hausdorff space, then $\prod X_{\alpha}$ is a Hausdorff space in both the box and product topologies.

!!! theorem "Theorem 19.5"
    Let $\left\{X_{\alpha}\right\}$ be an indexed family of spaces; let $A_{\alpha} \subset X_{\alpha}$ for each $\alpha$.
    If $\prod X_{\alpha}$ is given either the product or the box topology, then

    $$
    \prod \bar{A}_{\alpha}=\overline{\prod A_{\alpha}} .
    $$

    !!! proof
        Let $\mathbf{x}=\left(x_{\alpha}\right)$ be a point of $\prod \bar{A}_{\alpha}$; we show that $\mathbf{x} \in \overline{\prod A_{\alpha}}$.
        Let $U=\prod U_{\alpha}$ be a basis element for either the box or product topology that contains $\mathbf{x}$.
        Since $x_{\alpha} \in \bar{A}_{\alpha}$, we can choose a point $y_{\alpha} \in U_{\alpha} \cap A_{\alpha}$ for each $\alpha$.
        Then $\mathbf{y}=\left(y_{\alpha}\right)$ belongs to both $U$ and $\prod A_{\alpha}$.
        Since $U$ is arbitrary, it follows that $\mathbf{x}$ belongs to the closure of $\prod A_{\alpha}$.

        Conversely, suppose $\mathbf{x}=\left(x_{\alpha}\right)$ lies in the closure of $\prod A_{\alpha}$, in either topology.
        We show that for any given index $\beta$, we have $x_{\beta} \in \bar{A}_{\beta}$.
        Let $V_{\beta}$ be an arbitrary open set of $X_{\beta}$ containing $x_{\beta}$.
        Since $\pi_{\beta}^{-1}\left(V_{\beta}\right)$ is open in $\prod X_{\alpha}$ in either topology, it contains a point $\mathbf{y}=\left(y_{\alpha}\right)$ of $\prod A_{\alpha}$.
        Then $y_{\beta}$ belongs to $V_{\beta} \cap A_{\beta}$.
        It follows that $x_{\beta} \in \bar{A}_{\beta}$.

!!! theorem "Theorem 19.6"
    Let $f: A \rightarrow \prod_{\alpha \in J} X_{\alpha}$ be given by the equation

    $$
    f(a)=\left(f_{\alpha}(a)\right)_{\alpha \in J}
    $$

    where $f_{\alpha}: A \rightarrow X_{\alpha}$ for each $\alpha$.
    Let $\prod X_{\alpha}$ have the **product topology**.
    Then the function $f$ is continuous if and only if each function $f_{\alpha}$ is continuous.

    !!! proof
        Let $\pi_{\beta}$ be the projection of the product onto its $\beta$ th factor.
        The function $\pi_{\beta}$ is continuous, for if $U_{\beta}$ is open in $X_{\beta}$, the set $\pi_{\beta}^{-1}\left(U_{\beta}\right)$ is a subbasis element for the product topology on $X_{\alpha}$.
        Now suppose that $f: A \rightarrow \prod X_{\alpha}$ is continuous.
        The function $f_{\beta}$ equals the composite $\pi_{\beta} \circ f$; being the composite of two continuous functions, it is continuous.

        Conversely, suppose that each coordinate function $f_{\alpha}$ is continuous.
        To prove that $f$ is continuous, it suffices to prove that the inverse image under $f$ of each subbasis element is open in $A$; we remarked on this fact when we defined continuous functions.
        A typical subbasis element for the product topology on $\prod X_{\alpha}$ is a set of the form $\pi_{\beta}^{-1}\left(U_{\beta}\right)$, where $\beta$ is some index and $U_{\beta}$ is open in $X_{\beta}$.
        Now

        $$
        f^{-1}\left(\pi_{\beta}^{-1}\left(U_{\beta}\right)\right)=f_{\beta}^{-1}\left(U_{\beta}\right)
        $$

        because $f_{\beta}=\pi_{\beta} \circ f$.
        Since $f_{\beta}$ is continuous, this set is open in $A$, as desired.

!!! example "Example"
    **Theorem 19.6** fails when applied to **box topology**.

    Consider $\mathbb{R}^{\omega}$, the countably infinite product of $\mathbb{R}$ with itself. Recall that

    $$
    \mathbb{R}^{\omega}=\prod_{n \in \mathbb{Z}_{+}} X_{n}
    $$

    where $X_{n}=\mathbb{R}$ for each $n$. Let us define a function $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{\omega}$ by the equation

    $$
    f(t)=(t, t, t, \ldots)
    $$

    the $n$th coordinate function of $f$ is the function $f_{n}(t)=t$. Each of the coordinate functions $f_{n}: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is continuous; therefore, the function $f$ is continuous if $\mathbb{R}^{\omega}$ is given the product topology. But $f$ is not continuous if $\mathbb{R}^{\omega}$ is given the box topology. Consider, for example, the basis element

    $$
    B=(-1,1) \times\left(-\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}\right) \times\left(-\frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{3}\right) \times \cdots
    $$

    for the box topology. We assert that $f^{-1}(B)$ is not open in $\mathbb{R}$. If $f^{-1}(B)$ were open in $\mathbb{R}$, it would contain some interval $(-\delta, \delta)$ about the point 0 . This would mean that $f((-\delta, \delta)) \subset B$, so that, applying $\pi_{n}$ to both sides of the inclusion,

    $$
    f_{n}((-\delta, \delta))=(-\delta, \delta) \subset(-1 / n, 1 / n)
    $$

    for all $n$, a contradiction.
