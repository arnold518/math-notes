# ยง 12. Topological Spaces

!!! definition "Definition 12.1 : Topology / Topological Space"
    A **topology** on a set $X$ is a collection $\mathcal{T}$ of subsets of $X$ having the following properties:

    1. $\varnothing$ and $X$ are in $\mathcal{T}$.

    2. The union of the elements of any subcollection of $\mathcal{T}$ is in $\mathcal{T}$.

    3. The intersection of the elements of any finite subcollection of $\mathcal{T}$ is in $\mathcal{T}$.

    A set $X$ for which a topology $\mathcal{T}$ has been specified is called a **topological space**.

!!! definition "Definition 12.2 : Open Set"
    If $X$ is a topological space with topology $\mathcal{T}$, we say that a subset $U$ of $X$ is an **open set** of $X$ if $U$ belongs to the collection $\mathcal{T}$.

    Using this terminology, one can say that a topological space is a set $X$ together with a collection of subsets of $X$, called **open sets**, such that $\varnothing$ and $X$ are both open, and such that arbitrary unions and finite intersections of open sets are open.

!!! definition "Definition 12.3 : Discrete Topology / Indiscrete (Trivial) Topology"
    If $X$ is any set, the collection of all subsets of $X$ is a topology on $X$; it is called the **discrete topology**.
    
    The collection consisting of $X$ and $\varnothing$ only is also a topology on $X$; we shall call it the **indiscrete topology**, or the **trivial topology**.

!!! definition "Definition 12.4 : Finite Complement Topology"
    Let $X$ be a set; let $\mathcal{T}_{f}$ be the collection of all subsets $U$ of $X$ such that $X-U$ either is finite or is all of $X$.
    Then $\mathcal{T}_{f}$ is a topology on $X$, called the **finite complement topology**.

    !!! proof
        Let's show that $\mathcal{T}_{f}$ is indeed, a topology on $X$.

        Both $X$ and $\varnothing$ are in $\mathcal{T}_{f}$, since $X-X$ is finite and $X-\varnothing$ is all of $X$.  
        If $\left\{U_{\alpha}\right\}$ is an indexed family of nonempty elements of $\mathcal{T}_{f}$, to show that $\bigcup U_{\alpha}$ is in $\mathcal{T}_{f}$, we compute

        $$
        X-\bigcup U_{\alpha}=\bigcap\left(X-U_{\alpha}\right)
        $$

        The latter set is finite because each set $X-U_{\alpha}$ is finite.
        If $U_{1}, \ldots, U_{n}$ are nonempty elements of $\mathcal{T}_{f}$, to show that $\bigcap U_{i}$ is in $\mathcal{T}_{f}$, we compute

        $$
        X-\bigcap_{i=1}^{n} U_{i}=\bigcup_{i=1}^{n}\left(X-U_{i}\right)
        $$

        The latter set is a finite union of finite sets and, therefore, finite.

!!! definition "Definition 12.5 : Finer / Coarser / Comparable"
    Suppose that $\mathcal{T}$ and $\mathcal{T}^{\prime}$ are two topologies on a given set $X$.  
    If $\mathcal{T}^{\prime} \supset \mathcal{T}$, we say that $\mathcal{T}^{\prime}$ is **finer** than $\mathcal{T}$;
    if $\mathcal{T}^{\prime}$ properly contains $\mathcal{T}$, we say that $\mathcal{T}^{\prime}$ is **strictly finer** than $\mathcal{T}$.  
    We also say that $\mathcal{T}$ is **coarser** than $\mathcal{T}^{\prime}$, or **strictly coarser**, in these two respective situations.  
    We say $\mathcal{T}$ is **comparable with** $\mathcal{T}^{\prime}$ if either $\mathcal{T}^{\prime} \supset \mathcal{T}$ or $\mathcal{T} \supset \mathcal{T}^{\prime}$.

    Other terminology is sometimes used for this concept.
    If $\mathcal{T}^{\prime} \supset \mathcal{T}$, some mathematicians would say that $\mathcal{T}^{\prime}$ is **larger** than $\mathcal{T}$, and $\mathcal{T}$ is **smaller** than $\mathcal{T}^{\prime}$.
