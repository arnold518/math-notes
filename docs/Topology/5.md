!!! definition "Definition 5.1 : Indexed Family of Sets"
    Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a nonempty collection of sets.
    An **indexing function** for $\mathcal{A}$ is a surjective function $f$ from some set $J$, called the **index set**, to $\mathcal{A}$.
    The collection $\mathcal{A}$, together with the indexing function $f$, is called an **indexed family of sets**.
    Given $\alpha \in J$, we shall denote the set $f(\alpha)$ by the symbol $A_{\alpha}$.
    And we shall denote the indexed family itself by the symbol

    $$
    \left\{A_{\alpha}\right\}_{\alpha \in J}
    $$

    which is read "the family of all $A_{\alpha}$, as $\alpha$ ranges over $J$." Sometimes we write merely $\left\{A_{\alpha}\right\}$, if it is clear what the index set is.

!!! definition "Definition 5.2"
    Two especially useful index sets are the set $\{1, \ldots, n\}$ of positive integers from 1 to $n$, and the set $\mathbb{Z}_{+}$of all positive integers.
    For these index sets, we introduce some special notation.
    If a collection of sets is indexed by the set $\{1, \ldots, n\}$, we denote the indexed family by the symbol $\left\{A_{1}, \ldots, A_{n}\right\}$, and we denote the union and intersection, respectively, of the members of this family by the symbols

    $$
    A_{1} \cup \cdots \cup A_{n} \quad \text { and } \quad A_{1} \cap \cdots \cap A_{n} \text {. }
    $$

    In the case where the index set is the set $\mathbb{Z}_{+}$, we denote the indexed family by the symbol $\left\{A_{1}, A_{2}, \ldots\right\}$, and the union and intersection by the respective symbols

    $$
    A_{1} \cup A_{2} \cup \cdots \quad \text { and } \quad A_{1} \cap A_{2} \cap \cdots \text {. }
    $$

!!! definition "Definition 5.3 : $m$-Tuple / Cartesian Product"
    Let $m$ be a positive integer.
    Given a set $X$, we define an **$m$-tuple** of elements of $X$ to be a function

    $$
    \mathbf{x}:\{1, \ldots, m\} \rightarrow X
    $$

    If $\mathbf{x}$ is an $m$-tuple, we often denote the value of $\mathbf{x}$ at $i$ by the symbol $x_{i}$ rather than $\mathbf{x}(i)$ and call it the $i$ th **coordinate** of $\mathbf{x}$.
    And we often denote the function $\mathbf{x}$ itself by the symbol

    $$
    \left(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{m}\right)
    $$

    Now let $\left\{A_{1}, \ldots, A_{m}\right\}$ be a family of sets indexed with the set $\{1, \ldots, m\}$.
    Let $X=$ $A_{1} \cup \cdots \cup A_{m}$.
    We define the **cartesian product** of this indexed family, denoted by

    $$
    \prod_{i=1}^{m} A_{i} \quad \text { or } \quad A_{1} \times \cdots \times A_{m}
    $$

    to be the set of all $m$-tuples $\left(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{m}\right)$ of elements of $X$ such that $x_{i} \in A_{i}$ for each $i$.

    If the sets $A_i$ are all equal the same set $X$, the cartesian product $A_{1} \times$ $\cdots \times A_{m}$ is just the set of all $m$-tuples of elements of $X$, which we denote by $X^{m}$.

!!! definition "Definition 5.4 : $\omega$-Tuple / Cartesian Product"
    Given a set $X$, we define an **$\omega$-tuple** of elements of $X$ to be a function

    $$
    \mathbf{x}: \mathbb{Z}_{+} \longrightarrow X
    $$

    we also call such a function a **sequence**, or an **infinite sequence**, of elements of $X$.
    If $\mathbf{x}$ is an $\omega$-tuple, we often denote the value of $\mathbf{x}$ at $i$ by $x_{i}$ rather than $\mathbf{x}(i)$, and call it the $i$ th **coordinate** of $\mathbf{x}$.
    We denote $\mathbf{x}$ itself by the symbol

    $$
    \left(x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots\right) \quad \text { or } \quad\left(x_{n}\right)_{n \in \mathbb{Z}_{+}} \text {. }
    $$

    Now let $\left\{A_{1}, A_{2}, \ldots\right\}$ be a family of sets, indexed with the positive integers; let $X$ be the union of the sets in this family. The **cartesian product** of this indexed family of sets, denoted by

    $$
    \prod_{i \in \mathbb{Z}_{+}} A_{i} \quad \text { or } \quad A_{1} \times A_{2} \times \cdots
    $$

    is defined to be the set of all $\omega$-tuples $\left(x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots\right)$ of elements of $X$ such that $x_{i} \in A_{i}$ for each $i$.

    If the sets $A_i$ are all equal the same set $X$, the cartesian product $A_{1} \times$ $A_2 \times \cdots$ is just the set of all $\omega$-tuples of elements of $X$, which we denote by $X^{\omega}$.
