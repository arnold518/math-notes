# ยง 1. Fundamental Concepts

!!! definition "Definition 1.1 : Objects (Elements) of a Set"
    If an **object** $a$ **belongs** to a **set** $A$, we express this fact by the notation

    $$
    a \in A.
    $$

    If $a$ does **not belong** to $A$, we express this fact by writing

    $$
    a \notin A.
    $$

!!! definition "Definition 1.2 : Subset / Proper Subset"
    We say that $A$ is a **subset** of $B$ if every element of $A$ is also an element of $B$, and we express this fact by writing

    $$
    A \subset B.
    $$

    If $A \subset B$ and $A$ is different from $B$, we say that $A$ is a **proper subset** of $B$, and we write

    $$
    A \subsetneq B .
    $$

    The relations $\subset$ and $\subsetneq$ are called **inclusion** and **proper inclusion**, respectively. If $A \subset B$, we also write $B \supset A$, which is read "$B$ **contains** $A$."

!!! definition "Definition 1.3 : The Union of Sets"
    Given two sets $A$ and $B$, the set that consists of all the elements of $A$ together with all the elements of $B$ is called the **union** of $A$ and $B$ and is denoted by $A \cup B$. Formally, we define

    $$
    A \cup B=\{x \mid x \in A \text { or } x \in B\} .
    $$

!!! definition "Definition 1.4 : The Intersection of Sets"
    Given sets $A$ and $B$, the set formed by taking the common part of $A$ and $B$ is called the **intersection** of $A$ and $B$ and is denoted by $A \cap B$. Formally, we define

    $$
    A \cap B=\{x \mid x \in A \text { and } x \in B\} .
    $$

!!! definition "Definition 1.5 : Empty Set"
    The **empty set**, denoted by $\varnothing$ is the set having no elements.

!!! definition "Definition 1.6 : Disjoint Sets"
    We express the statement that $A$ and $B$ have no elements in common by saying that $A$ and $B$ are **disjoint**.

    $$
    A \cap B=\varnothing .
    $$

!!! definition "Definition 1.7 : Statement / Hypothesis / Conclusion"
    A **statement** of the form **"If $P$, then $Q$"** means that if $P$ is true, $Q$ is true also, but if $P$ is false, $Q$ may be either true or false.
    It is read **"$P$ implies $Q$."**, and denoted by

    $$
    P \Longrightarrow Q.
    $$

    $P$ is called the **hypothesis** of the statement, and $Q$ is called the **conclusion** of the statement.

!!! definition "Definition 1.8 : Vacuously True"
    For a statement, if there are no cases for which the hypothesis holds, the statement is said to be **vacuously true**.

!!! definition "Definition 1.9 : Contrapositive"
    Given a statement of the form "If $P$, then $Q$," its **contrapositive** is defined to be the statement "If $Q$ is not true, then $P$ is not true."

    $$
    (\operatorname{not} Q) \Longrightarrow(\operatorname{not} P)
    $$

    A statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent.

!!! definition "Definition 1.10 : Converse"
    Given a statement of the form "If $P$, then $Q$," its **converse** is defined to be the statement "If $Q$, then $P$."

    $$
    Q \Longrightarrow P
    $$

    A statement and its converse are not necessarily logically equivalent.

!!! definition "Definition 1.11 : If and Only If"
    If both the statement $P \Rightarrow Q$ and its converse $Q \Rightarrow P$ are true, we express this fact by the notation

    $$
    P \Longleftrightarrow Q,
    $$

    which is read **"$P$ holds if and only if $Q$ holds."**

!!! definition "Definition 1.12 : Negation"
    The statement "not $P$," is called the **negation** of $P$.

    The negation of logical quantifier "for every" is "for at least one".

!!! definition "Definition 1.13 : The Difference of Two Sets"
    The **difference** of two sets, denoted by $A-B$, and defined as the set consisting of those elements of $A$ that are not in $B$. Formally,

    $$
    A-B=\{x \mid x \in A \text { and } x \notin B\} .
    $$

    It is sometimes called the **complement of $B$ relative to $A$**, or the **complement of $B$ in $A$**.

!!! theorem "Theorem 1.1 : Distributive Law"
    $$
    A \cap(B \cup C)=(A \cap B) \cup(A \cap C)
    $$

    $$
    A \cup(B \cap C)=(A \cup B) \cap(A \cup C)
    $$

!!! theorem "Theorem 1.2 : DeMorgan's Law"
    $$
    A-(B \cup C)=(A-B) \cap(A-C)
    $$

    $$
    A-(B \cap C)=(A-B) \cup(A-C)
    $$

!!! definition "Definition 1.14 : Power Set / Collection of Sets"
    Given a set $A$, we can consider the set of all subsets of $A$.
    This set is sometimes denoted by the symbol $\mathcal{P}(A)$ and is called the **power set** of $A$.

    When we have a set whose elements are sets, we shall often refer to it as a **collection of sets** and denote it by a script letter such as $\mathcal{A}$ or $\mathcal{B}$.

!!! definition "Definition 1.15 : Arbitrary Unions"
    Given a collection $\mathcal{A}$ of sets, the **union** of the elements of $\mathcal{A}$ is defined by the equation

    $$
    \bigcup_{A \in \mathcal{A}} A=\{x \mid x \in A \text { for at least one } A \in \mathcal{A}\}.
    $$
    
!!! definition "Definition 1.16 : Arbitrary Intersections"
    Given a collection $\mathcal{A}$ of sets, the **intersection** of the elements of $\mathcal{A}$ is defined by the equation

    $$
    \bigcap_{A \in \mathcal{A}} A=\{x \mid x \in A \text { for every } A \in \mathcal{A}\}.
    $$
    
    We shall not define the intersection when $\mathcal{A}$ is empty.

!!! definition "Definition 1.17 : Cartesian Product"
    Given sets $A$ and $B$, we define their **cartesian product** $A \times B$ to be the set of all ordered pairs $(a, b)$ for which $a$ is an element of $A$ and $b$ is an element of $B$.
    Formally,

    $$
    A \times B=\{(a, b) \mid a \in A \text { and } b \in B\}
    $$
