# ยง 16. The Subspace Topology

!!! definition "Definition 16.1 : Subspace Topology / Subspace"
    Let $X$ be a topological space with topology $\mathcal{T}$. If $Y$ is a subset of $X$, the collection

    $$
    \mathcal{T}_{Y}=\{Y \cap U \mid U \in \mathcal{T}\}
    $$

    is a topology on $Y$, called the **subspace topology**.
    With this topology, $Y$ is called a **subspace** of $X$; its open sets consist of all intersections of open sets of $X$ with $Y$.

!!! theorem "Theorem 16.0"
    $\mathcal{T}_{Y}$ is indeed a topology.

    !!! proof
        $\mathcal{T}_{Y}$ contains $\varnothing$ and $Y$ because

        $$
        \varnothing=Y \cap \varnothing \quad \text { and } \quad Y=Y \cap X
        $$

        where $\varnothing$ and $X$ are elements of $\mathcal{T}$.
        The fact that it is closed under finite intersections and arbitrary unions follows from the equations

        $$
        \begin{aligned}
        \left(U_{1} \cap Y\right) \cap \cdots \cap\left(U_{n} \cap Y\right) & =\left(U_{1} \cap \cdots \cap U_{n}\right) \cap Y \\
        \bigcup_{\alpha \in J}\left(U_{\alpha} \cap Y\right) & =\left(\bigcup_{\alpha \in J} U_{\alpha}\right) \cap Y .
        \end{aligned}
        $$
    
!!! theorem "Lemma 16.1"
    If $\mathcal{B}$ is a basis for the topology of $X$ then the collection

    $$
    \mathcal{B}_{Y}=\{B \cap Y \mid B \in \mathcal{B}\}
    $$

    is a basis for the subspace topology on $Y$.

    !!! proof
        Given $U$ open in $X$ and given $y \in U \cap Y$, we can choose an element $B$ of $\mathcal{B}$ such that $y \in B \subset U$.
        Then $y \in B \cap Y \subset U \cap Y$.
        It follows from **Lemma 13.2** that $\mathcal{B}_{Y}$ is a basis for the subspace topology on $Y$.

!!! definition "Definition 16.2 : Open In"
    If $Y$ is a subspace of $X$, we say that a set $U$ is **open in** $Y$ (or open relative to $Y$ ) if it belongs to the topology of $Y$; this implies in particular that it is a subset of $Y$.
    We say that $U$ is **open in** $X$ if it belongs to the topology of $X$.

!!! theorem "Lemma 16.2"
    Let $Y$ be a subspace of $X$.
    If $U$ is open in $Y$ and $Y$ is open in $X$, then $U$ is open in $X$.

    !!! proof
        Since $U$ is open in $Y, U=Y \cap V$ for some set $V$ open in $X$.
        Since $Y$ and $V$ are both open in $X$, so is $Y \cap V$.

!!! theorem "Theorem 16.3"
    (Subspace topology $\Leftrightarrow$ Product topology)  
    If $A$ is a subspace of $X$ and $B$ is a subspace of $Y$, then the product topology on $A \times B$ is the same as the topology $A \times B$ inherits as a subspace of $X \times Y$.

    !!! proof
        The set $U \times V$ is the general basis element for $X \times Y$, where $U$ is open in $X$ and $V$ is open in $Y$.
        Therefore, $(U \times V) \cap(A \times B)$ is the general basis element for the subspace topology on $A \times B$.
        Now

        $$
        (U \times V) \cap(A \times B)=(U \cap A) \times(V \cap B) .
        $$

        Since $U \cap A$ and $V \cap B$ are the general open sets for the subspace topologies on $A$ and $B$, respectively, the set $(U \cap A) \times(V \cap B)$ is the general basis element for the product topology on $A \times B$.

        The conclusion we draw is that the bases for the subspace topology on $A \times B$ and for the product topology on $A \times B$ are the same.
        Hence the topologies are the same.

!!! theorem "Theorem 16.3.1"
    (Subspace topology $\nLeftrightarrow$ Order topology)  
    Let $X$ be an ordered set in the order topology, and let $Y$ be a subset of $X$.
    The order relation on $X$, when restricted to $Y$, makes $Y$ into an ordered set.
    However, the resulting order topology on $Y$ need **not** be the same as the topology that $Y$ inherits as a subspace of $X$.

    !!! example
        Let $Y$ be the subset $[0,1) \cup\{2\}$ of $\mathbb{R}$.
        In the subspace topology on $Y$ the one-point set $\{2\}$ is open, because it is the intersection of the open set $\left(\frac{3}{2}, \frac{5}{2}\right)$ with $Y$.
        But in the order topology on $Y$, the set $\{2\}$ is not open.
        Any basis element for the order topology on $Y$ that contains 2 is of the form

        $$
        \{x \mid x \in Y \text { and } a<x \leq 2\}
        $$

        for some $a \in Y$; such a set necessarily contains points of $Y$ less than 2.
    
    !!! example
        Let $I=[0,1]$.
        The dictionary order on $I \times I$ is just the restriction to $I \times I$ of the dictionary order on the plane $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$.
        However, the dictionary order topology on $I \times I$ is not the same as the subspace topology on $I \times I$ obtained from the dictionary order topology on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$ !
        For example, the set $\{1 / 2\} \times(1 / 2,1]$ is open in $I \times I$ in the subspace topology, but not in the order topology, as you can check.

!!! definition "Definition 16.3 : Ordered Square"
    Let $I=[0,1]$.
    The dictionary order on $I \times I$ is just the restriction to $I \times I$ of the dictionary order on the plane $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$.
    The set $I \times I$ in the dictionary order topology will be called the **ordered square**, and denoted by $I_{o}^{2}$.

!!! definition "Definition 16.4 : Convex"
    Given an ordered set $X$, let us say that a subset $Y$ of $X$ is **convex** in $X$ if for each pair of points $a<b$ of $Y$, the entire interval $(a, b)$ of points of $X$ lies in $Y$.
    Note that intervals and rays in $X$ are convex in $X$.

!!! theorem "Theorem 16.4"
    (Subspace topology $\Leftrightarrow$ Order topology) (In convex subspace)  
    Let $X$ be an ordered set in the order topology; let $Y$ be a subset of $X$ that is convex in $X$.
    Then the order topology on $Y$ is the same as the topology $Y$ inherits as a subspace of $X$.

    !!! proof
        Consider the ray $(a,+\infty)$ in $X$.
        What is its intersection with $Y$ ?
        If $a \in Y$, then

        $$
        (a,+\infty) \cap Y=\{x \mid x \in Y \text { and } x>a\}
        $$

        this is an open ray of the ordered set $Y$. 
        If $a \notin Y$, then $a$ is either a lower bound on $Y$

        or an upper bound on $Y$, since $Y$ is convex.
        In the former case, the set $(a,+\infty) \cap Y$ equals all of $Y$; in the latter case, it is empty.

        A similar remark shows that the intersection of the ray $(-\infty, a)$ with $Y$ is either an open ray of $Y$, or $Y$ itself, or empty.
        Since the sets $(a,+\infty) \cap Y$ and $(-\infty, a) \cap Y$ form a subbasis for the subspace topology on $Y$, and since each is open in the order topology, the order topology contains the subspace topology.

        To prove the reverse, note that any open ray of $Y$ equals the intersection of an open ray of $X$ with $Y$, so it is open in the subspace topology on $Y$.
        Since the open rays of $Y$ are a subbasis for the order topology on $Y$, this topology is contained in the subspace topology.
