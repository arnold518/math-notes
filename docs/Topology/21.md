# ยง 21. The Metric Topology (continued)

!!! example "Note"
    Subspaces of metric spaces behave the way one would wish them to; if $A$ is a subspace of the topological space $X$ and $d$ is a metric for $X$, then the restriction of $d$ to $A \times A$ is a metric for the topology of $A$.

    About order topologies there is nothing to be said; some are metrizable (for instance, $\mathbb{Z}_{+}$and $\mathbb{R}$ ), and others are not, as we shall see.

    The Hausdorff axiom is satisfied by every metric topology.
    If $x$ and $y$ are distinct points of the metric space $(X, d)$, we let $\epsilon=\frac{1}{2} d(x, y)$; then the triangle inequality implies that $B_{d}(x, \epsilon)$ and $B_{d}(y, \epsilon)$ are disjoint.

    The product topology we have already considered in special cases; we have proved that the products $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and $\mathbb{R}^{\omega}$ are metrizable. It is true in general that countable products of metrizable spaces are metrizable; the proof follows a pattern similar to the proof for $\mathbb{R}^{\omega}$.

!!! theorem "Theorem 21.1"
    Let $f: X \rightarrow Y$; let $X$ and $Y$ be metrizable with metrics $d_{X}$ and $d_{Y}$, respectively.
    Then continuity of $f$ is equivalent to the requirement that given $x \in X$ and given $\epsilon>0$, there exists $\delta>0$ such that

    $$
    d_{X}(x, y)<\delta \Longrightarrow d_{Y}(f(x), f(y))<\epsilon
    $$

    !!! proof
        Suppose that $f$ is continuous. Given $x$ and $\epsilon$, consider the set

        $$
        f^{-1}(B(f(x), \epsilon)),
        $$

        which is open in $X$ and contains the point $x$.
        It contains some $\delta$-ball $B(x, \delta)$ centered at $x$.
        If $y$ is in this $\delta$-ball, then $f(y)$ is in the $\epsilon$-ball centered at $f(x)$, as desired.

        Conversely, suppose that the $\epsilon-\delta$ condition is satisfied.
        Let $V$ be open in $Y$; we show that $f^{-1}(V)$ is open in $X$.
        Let $x$ be a point of the set $f^{-1}(V)$. Since $f(x) \in$ $V$, there is an $\epsilon$-ball $B(f(x), \epsilon)$ centered at $f(x)$ and contained in $V$.
        By the $\epsilon$ $\delta$ condition, there is a $\delta$-ball $B(x, \delta)$ centered at $x$ such that $f(B(x, \delta)) \subset B(f(x), \epsilon)$.
        Then $B(x, \delta)$ is a neighborhood of $x$ contained in $f^{-1}(V)$, so that $f^{-1}(V)$ is open, as desired.

!!! theorem "Lemma 21.2 : The Sequence Lemma"
    Let $X$ be a topological space; let $A \subset X$.
    If there is a sequence of points of $A$ converging to $x$, then $x \in \bar{A}$; the converse holds if $X$ is metrizable.

    !!! proof
        Suppose that $x_{n} \rightarrow x$, where $x_{n} \in A$.
        Then every neighborhood $U$ of $x$ contains a point of $A$, so $x \in \bar{A}$ by **Theorem 17.5**.

        Conversely, suppose that $X$ is metrizable and $x \in \bar{A}$.
        Let $d$ be a metric for the topology of $X$.
        For each positive integer $n$, take the neighborhood $B_{d}(x, 1 / n)$ of radius $1 / n$ of $x$, and choose $x_{n}$ to be a point of its intersection with $A$.
        We assert that the sequence $x_{n}$ converges to $x$ : Any open set $U$ containing $x$ contains an $\epsilon$-ball $B_{d}(x, \epsilon)$ centered at $x$; if we choose $N$ so that $1 / N<\epsilon$, then $U$ contains $x_{i}$ for all $i \geq N$.

!!! theorem "Theorem 21.3"
    Let $f: X \rightarrow Y$.
    If the function $f$ is continuous, then for every convergent sequence $x_{n} \rightarrow x$ in $X$, the sequence $f\left(x_{n}\right)$ converges to $f(x)$.
    The converse holds if $X$ is metrizable.

    !!! proof
        Assume that $f$ is continuous.
        Given $x_{n} \rightarrow x$, we wish to show that $f\left(x_{n}\right) \rightarrow$ $f(x)$.
        Let $V$ be a neighborhood of $f(x)$.
        Then $f^{-1}(V)$ is a neighborhood of $x$, and so there is an $N$ such that $x_{n} \in f^{-1}(V)$ for $n \geq N$.
        Then $f\left(x_{n}\right) \in V$ for $n \geq N$.

        To prove the converse, assume that the convergent sequence condition is satisfied.
        Let $A$ be a subset of $X$; we show that $f(\bar{A}) \subset \overline{f(A)}$.
        If $x \in \bar{A}$, then there is a sequence $x_{n}$ of points of $A$ converging to $x$ (by **Lemma 21.2**).
        By assumption, the sequence $f\left(x_{n}\right)$ converges to $f(x)$.
        Since $f\left(x_{n}\right) \in f(A)$, the preceding lemma implies that $f(x) \in \overline{f(A)}$.
        (Note that metrizability of $Y$ is not needed.)
        Hence $f(\bar{A}) \subset$ $\overline{f(A)}$, as desired.

!!! definition "Definition 21.1 : Countable Basis at the Point $x$ / First Countability Axiom"
    A space $X$ is said to have a **countable basis at the point $x$** if there is a countable collection $\left\{U_{n}\right\}_{n \in \mathbb{Z}_{+}}$of neighborhoods of $x$ such that any neighborhood $U$ of $x$ contains at least one of the sets $U_{n}$.
    A space $X$ that has a countable basis at each of its points is said to satisfy the **first countability axiom**.

!!! theorem "Lemma 21.4"
    The addition, subtraction, and multiplication operations are continuous functions from $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$ into $\mathbb{R}$; and the quotient operation is a continuous function from $\mathbb{R} \times(\mathbb{R}-\{0\})$ into $\mathbb{R}$.

!!! theorem "Theorem 21.5"
    If $X$ is a topological space, and if $f, g: X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ are continuous functions, then $f+g, f-g$, and $f \cdot g$ are continuous.
    If $g(x) \neq 0$ for all $x$, then $f / g$ is continuous.

    !!! proof
        The map $h: X \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$ defined by

        $$
        h(x)=f(x) \times g(x)
        $$

        is continuous, by Theorem 18.4. The function $f+g$ equals the composite of $h$ and the addition operation

        $$
        +: \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}
        $$

        therefore $f+g$ is continuous. Similar arguments apply to $f-g, f \cdot g$, and $f / g$.

!!! definition "Definition 21.2 : Converge Uniformly"
    Let $f_{n}: X \rightarrow Y$ be a sequence of functions from the set $X$ to the metric space $Y$.
    Let $d$ be the metric for $Y$.
    We say that the sequence $\left(f_{n}\right)$ converges uniformly to the function $f: X \rightarrow Y$ if given $\epsilon>0$, there exists an integer $N$ such that

    $$
    d\left(f_{n}(x), f(x)\right)<\epsilon
    $$

    for all $n>N$ and all $x$ in $X$.

!!! theorem "Theorem 21.6 : Uniform Limit Theorem"
    Let $f_{n}: X \rightarrow Y$ be a sequence of continuous functions from the topological space $X$ to the metric space $Y$.
    If $\left(f_{n}\right)$ converges uniformly to $f$, then $f$ is continuous.

    !!! proof
        Let $V$ be open in $Y$; let $x_{0}$ be a point of $f^{-1}(V)$.
        We wish to find a neighborhood $U$ of $x_{0}$ such that $f(U) \subset V$.

        Let $y_{0}=f\left(x_{0}\right)$.
        First choose $\epsilon$ so that the $\epsilon$-ball $B\left(y_{0}, \epsilon\right)$ is contained in $V$.
        Then, using uniform convergence, choose $N$ so that for all $n \geq N$ and all $x \in X$,

        $$
        d\left(f_{n}(x), f(x)\right)<\epsilon / 3
        $$

        Finally, using continuity of $f_{N}$, choose a neighborhood $U$ of $x_{0}$ such that $f_{N}$ carries $U$ into the $\epsilon / 3$ ball in $Y$ centered at $f_{N}\left(x_{0}\right)$.

        We claim that $f$ carries $U$ into $B\left(y_{0}, \epsilon\right)$ and hence into $V$, as desired.
        For this purpose, note that if $x \in U$, then

        $$
        \begin{aligned}
        d\left(f(x), f_{N}(x)\right)<\epsilon / 3 & \text { (by choice of } N), \\
        d\left(f_{N}(x), f_{N}\left(x_{0}\right)\right)<\epsilon / 3 & \text { (by choice of } U), \\
        d\left(f_{N}\left(x_{0}\right), f\left(x_{0}\right)\right)<\epsilon / 3 & \text { (by choice of } N).
        \end{aligned}
        $$

        Adding and using the triangle inequality, we see that $d\left(f(x), f\left(x_{0}\right)\right)<\epsilon$, as desired.

!!! example "Note"
    Let us remark that the notion of uniform convergence is related to the definition of the uniform metric.
    Consider, for example, the space $\mathbb{R}^{X}$ of all functions $f: X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, in the uniform metric $\bar{\rho}$.
    It is not difficult to see that a sequence of functions $f_{n}: X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ converges uniformly to $f$ if and only if the sequence $\left(f_{n}\right)$ converges to $f$ when they are considered as elements of the metric space $\left(\mathbb{R}^{X}, \bar{\rho}\right)$.

!!! example
    $\mathbb{R}^{\omega}$ in the box topology is not metrizable.

    We shall show that the sequence lemma does not hold for $\mathbb{R}^{\omega}$. Let $A$ be the subset of $\mathbb{R}^{\omega}$ consisting of those points all of whose coordinates are positive:

    $$
    A=\left\{\left(x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots\right) \mid x_{i}>0 \text { for all } i \in \mathbb{Z}_{+}\right\}
    $$

    Let $\mathbf{0}$ be the "origin" in $\mathbb{R}^{\omega}$, that is, the point $(0,0, \ldots)$ each of whose coordinates is zero. In the box topology, $\mathbf{0}$ belongs to $\bar{A}$; for if

    $$
    B=\left(a_{1}, b_{1}\right) \times\left(a_{2}, b_{2}\right) \times \cdots
    $$

    is any basis element containing $\mathbf{0}$, then $B$ intersects $A$. For instance, the point

    $$
    \left(\frac{1}{2} b_{1}, \frac{1}{2} b_{2} \ldots\right)
    $$

    belongs to $B \cap A$.

    But we assert that there is no sequence of points of $A$ converging to $\mathbf{0}$. For let $\left(\mathbf{a}_{n}\right)$ be a sequence of points of $A$, where

    $$
    \mathbf{a}_{n}=\left(x_{1 n}, x_{2 n}, \ldots, x_{i n}, \ldots\right) .
    $$

    Every coordinate $x_{i n}$ is positive, so we can construct a basis element $B^{\prime}$ for the box topology on $\mathbb{R}$ by setting

    $$
    B^{\prime}=\left(-x_{11}, x_{11}\right) \times\left(-x_{22}, x_{22}\right) \times \cdots .
    $$

    Then $B^{\prime}$ contains the origin $\mathbf{0}$, but it contains no member of the sequence $\left(\mathbf{a}_{n}\right)$; the point $\mathbf{a}_{n}$ cannot belong to $B^{\prime}$ because its $n$th coordinate $x_{n n}$ does not belong to the interval $\left(-x_{n n}, x_{n n}\right)$. Hence the sequence $\left(\mathbf{a}_{n}\right)$ cannot converge to $\mathbf{0}$ in the box topology.

!!! example
    An uncountable product of $\mathbb{R}$ with itself is not metrizable.

    Let $J$ be an uncountable index set; we show that $\mathbb{R}^{J}$ does not satisfy the sequence lemma (in the product topology).

    Let $A$ be the subset of $\mathbb{R}^{J}$ consisting of all points $\left(x_{\alpha}\right)$ such that $x_{\alpha}=1$ for all but finitely many values of $\alpha$.
    Let $\mathbf{0}$ be the "origin" in $\mathbb{R}^{J}$, the point each of whose coordinates is 0 .

    We assert that $\mathbf{0}$ belongs to the closure of $A$. Let $\prod U_{\alpha}$ be a basis element containing $\mathbf{0}$.
    Then $U_{\alpha} \neq \mathbb{R}$ for only finitely many values of $\alpha$, say for $\alpha=\alpha_{1}, \ldots, \alpha_{n}$.
    Let $\left(x_{\alpha}\right)$ be the point of $A$ defined by letting $x_{\alpha}=0$ for $\alpha=\alpha_{1}, \ldots, \alpha_{n}$ and $x_{\alpha}=1$ for all other values of $\alpha$; then $\left(x_{\alpha}\right) \in A \cap \prod U_{\alpha}$, as desired.

    But there is no sequence of points of $A$ converging to $\mathbf{0}$.
    For let $\mathbf{a}_{n}$ be a sequence of points of $A$.
    Given $n$, let $J_{n}$ denote the subset of $J$ consisting of those indices $\alpha$ for which the $\alpha$ th coordinate of $\mathbf{a}_{n}$ is different from 1.
    The union of all the sets $J_{n}$ is a countable union of finite sets and therefore countable.
    Because $J$ itself is uncountable, there is an index in $J$, say $\beta$, that does not lie in any of the sets $J_{n}$.
    This means that for each of the points $\mathbf{a}_{n}$, its $\beta$ th coordinate equals 1 .

    Now let $U_{\beta}$ be the open interval $(-1,1)$ in $\mathbb{R}$, and let $U$ be the open set $\pi_{\beta}^{-1}\left(U_{\beta}\right)$ in $\mathbb{R}^{J}$.
    The set $U$ is a neighborhood of $\mathbf{0}$ that contains none of the points $\mathbf{a}_{n}$; therefore, the sequence $\mathbf{a}_{n}$ cannot converge to $\mathbf{0}$.
