!!! definition "Definition 2.1 : Rule of Assignment"
    A **rule of assignment** is a subset $r$ of the cartesian product $C \times D$ of two sets, having the property that each element of $C$ appears as the first coordinate of at most one ordered pair belonging to $r$.

    Thus, a subset $r$ of $C \times D$ is a rule of assignment if

    $$
    \left[(c, d) \in r \text { and }\left(c, d^{\prime}\right) \in r\right] \Longrightarrow\left[d=d^{\prime}\right]
    $$

    We think of $r$ as a way of assigning, to the element $c$ of $C$, the element $d$ of $D$ for which $(c, d) \in r$.

!!! definition "Definition 2.2 : Domain / Image Set"
    Given a rule of assignment $r$, the **domain** of $r$ is defined to be the subset of $C$ consisting of all first coordinates of elements of $r$, and the **image set** of $r$ is defined as the subset of $D$ consisting of all second coordinates of elements of $r$.
    Formally,

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    \text { domain } r & =\{c \mid \text { there exists } d \in D \text { such that }(c, d) \in r\}, \\
    \text { image } r & =\{d \mid \text { there exists } c \in C \text { such that }(c, d) \in r\} .
    \end{aligned}
    $$

    Note that given a rule of assignment $r$, its domain and image are entirely determined.

!!! definition "Definition 2.3 : Function"
    A **function** $f$ is a rule of assignment $r$, together with a set $B$ that contains the image set of $r$.  
    The domain $A$ of the rule $r$ is also called the **domain** of the function $f$.  
    The image set of $r$ is also called the **image set** of $f$.  
    The set $B$ is called the **range** of $f$.

    If $f$ is a function having domain $A$ and range $B$, we express this fact by writing

    $$
    f: A \longrightarrow B
    $$

    which is read **"$f$ is a function from $A$ to $B$"**, or **"$f$ is a mapping from $A$ into $B$"**, or simply **"$f$ maps $A$ into $B$"**.

    If $f: A \rightarrow B$ and if $a$ is an element of $A$, we denote by $f(a)$ the unique element of $B$ that the rule determining $f$ assigns to $a$; it is called the **value of $f$ at $a$**, or sometimes the **image of $a$ under $f$**. Formally, if $r$ is the rule of the function $f$, then $f(a)$ denotes the unique element of $B$ such that $(a, f(a)) \in r$.

!!! definition "Definition 2.4 : Restriction"
    If $f: A \rightarrow B$ and if $A_{0}$ is a subset of $A$, we define the **restriction** of $f$ to $A_{0}$ to be the function mapping $A_{0}$ into $B$ whose rule is

    $$
    \left\{(a, f(a)) \mid a \in A_{0}\right\} .
    $$

    It is denoted by $f \mid A_{0}$, which is read **"$f$ restricted to $A_{0}$"**.

!!! definition "Definition 2.5 : Composite"
    Given functions $f: A \rightarrow B$ and $g: B \rightarrow C$, we define the composite $g \circ f$ of $f$ and $g$ as the function $g \circ f: A \rightarrow C$ defined by the equation $(g \circ f)(a)=g(f(a))$.

    Formally, $g \circ f: A \rightarrow C$ is the function whose rule is

    $$
    \{(a, c) \mid \text { For some } b \in B, f(a)=b \text { and } g(b)=c\} \text {. }
    $$

    Note that $g \circ f$ is defined only when the range of $f$ equals the domain of $g$.

!!! definition "Definition 2.6 : Injective / Surjective / Bijective"
    A function $f: A \rightarrow B$ is said to be **injective (or one-to-one)** if for each pair of distinct points of $A$, their images under $f$ are distinct.  
    It is said to be **surjective (or $f$ is said to map $A$ onto $B$)** if every element of $B$ is the image of some element of $A$ under the function $f$.  
    If $f$ is both injective and surjective, it is said to be **bijective (or is called a one-to-one correspondence)**.

    More formally, $f$ is injective if

    $$
    \left[f(a)=f\left(a^{\prime}\right)\right] \Longrightarrow\left[a=a^{\prime}\right]
    $$

    and $f$ is surjective if

    $$
    [b \in B] \Longrightarrow[b=f(a) \text { for at least one } a \in A] \text {. }
    $$


!!! definition "Definition 2.7 : Inverse"
    If $f$ is bijective, there exists a function from $B$ to $A$ called the **inverse** of $f$.
    It is denoted by $f^{-1}$ and is defined by letting $f^{-1}(b)$ be that unique element $a$ of $A$ for which $f(a)=b$.

!!! theorem "Lemma 2.1"
    Let $f: A \rightarrow B$.
    If there are functions $g: B \rightarrow A$ and $h: B \rightarrow A$ such that $g(f(a))=a$ for every $a$ in $A$ and $f(h(b))=b$ for every $b$ in $B$, then $f$ is bijective and $g=h=f^{-1}$.

!!! definition "Definition 2.8 : Image / Preimage"
    Let $f: A \rightarrow B$.
    If $A_{0}$ is a subset of $A$, we denote by $f\left(A_{0}\right)$ the set of all images of points of $A_{0}$ under the function $f$; this set is called the **image of $A_{0}$ under $f$**.
    Formally,

    $$
    f\left(A_{0}\right)=\left\{b \mid b=f(a) \text { for at least one } a \in A_{0}\right\}
    $$

    If $B_{0}$ is a subset of $B$, we denote by $f^{-1}\left(B_{0}\right)$ the set of all elements of $A$ whose images under $f$ lie in $B_{0}$; it is called the **preimage of $B_{0}$ under $f$** (or the **"counterimage"**, or the **"inverse image"**, of $B_{0}$ ).
    Formally,

    $$
    f^{-1}\left(B_{0}\right)=\left\{a \mid f(a) \in B_{0}\right\}
    $$
