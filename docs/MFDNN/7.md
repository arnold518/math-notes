# ยง 7. ImageNet Challenge

!!! concept "Concept 7.1 : ImageNet Dataset"
    **ImageNet** contains more 14 million hand-annotated images in more than 20,000 categories.
    Many classes, higher resolution, non-uniform image size, multiple objects per image.

    **History**

    - Fei-Fei Li started the ImageNet project in 2006 with the goal of expanding and improving the data available for training Al algorithms.
    - Images were annotated with Amazon Mechanical Turk.
    - The ImageNet team first presented their dataset in the 2009 Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).
    - From 2010 to 2017, the ImageNet project ran the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC).
    - In the 2012 ILSVRC challenge, 150,000 images of 1000 classes were used.
    - In 2017, 29 teams achieved above 95\% accuracy. The organizers deemed task complete and ended the ILSVRC competition.

    **ImageNet-1k**

    Commonly referred to as "the ImageNet dataset". Also called ImageNet2012.
    However, ImageNet-1k is really a subset of full ImageNet dataset.
    ImageNet-1k has 150,000 images of 1000 roughly balanced classes.

    **Top-1 vs Top-5 Accuracy**

    Classifiers on ImageNet-1k are often assessed by their top-5 accuracy, which requires the 5 categories with the highest confidence to contain the label.
    In contrast, the top-1 accuracy simply measures whether the network's single prediction is the label.
    
    For example, AlexNet had a top-5 accuracy of 84.6% and a top-1 accuracy of 63.3%.
    Nowadays, accuracies of classifiers has improved, so the top 1 accuracy is becoming the more common metric.
