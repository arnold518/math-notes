# ยง 2. Binary Operations

## Definitions and Examples

!!! definition "Definition 2.1 : Binary Operation"
    A **binary operation** $*$ on a set $S$ is a function mapping $S \times S$ into $S$.
    For each $(a, b) \in$ $S \times S$, we will denote the element $*((a, b))$ of $S$ by $a * b$.

!!! definition "Definition 2.4 : Closed Under / Induced Operation"
    Let $*$ be a binary operation on $S$ and let $H$ be a subset of $S$.
    The subset $H$ is **closed under** $*$ if for all $a, b \in H$ we also have $a * b \in H$.
    In this case, the binary operation on $H$ given by restricting $*$ to $H$ is the **induced operation** of $*$ on $H$.

!!! definition "Definition 2.11 : Commutativity"
    A binary operation $*$ on a set $S$ is **commutative** if (and only if) $a * b=b * a$ for all $a, b \in S$.

!!! definition "Definition 2.12 : Associativity"
    A binary operation on a set $S$ is **associative** if $(a * b) * c=a *(b * c)$ for all $a, b, c \in S$.

!!! theorem "Theorem 2.13 : Associativity of Composition"
    Let $S$ be a set and let $f, g$, and $h$ be functions mapping $S$ into $S$.
    Then $f \circ(g \circ h)=(f \circ g) \circ h$.

    !!! proof
        To show these two functions are equal, we must show that they give the same assignment to each $x \in S$.
        Computing we find that

        $$
        (f \circ(g \circ h))(x)=f((g \circ h)(x))=f(g(h(x)))
        $$

        and

        $$
        ((f \circ g) \circ h)(x)=(f \circ g)(h(x))=f(g(h(x))),
        $$

        so the same element $f(g(h(x)))$ of $S$ is indeed obtained.

## Tables

!!! concept "Concept 2.14 : Table of Binary Operation"
    For a finite set, a binary operation on the set can be defined by means of a **table** in which the elements of the set are listed across the top as heads of columns and at the left side as heads of rows.
    We always require that the elements of the set be listed as heads across the top in the same order as heads down the left side.

    $$
    \begin{gathered}
    (i \text{ th entry on the left}) * (j \text{ th entry on the top}) \\
    = ( \text{entry in the } i \text{ th row and } j \text{ th column of the table body})
    \end{gathered}
    $$

    $$
    \begin{array}{c|c|c|c}
    * & a & b & c \\
    \hline
    a & b & c & b \\
    \hline
    b & a & c & b \\
    \hline
    c & c & b & a
    \end{array}
    $$

**Some Words of Warning**

Remember that in an attempt to define a binary operation $*$ on a set $\mathrm{S}$ we must be sure that

1. exactly one element is assigned to each possible ordered pair of elements of $S$,
2. for each ordered pair of elements of $S$, the element assigned to it is again in $S$.

Regarding Condition 1, a student will often make an attempt that assigns an element of $S$ to "most" ordered pairs, but for a few pairs, determines no element.
In this event, * is **not everywhere defined** on $S$.
It may also happen that for some pairs, the attempt could assign any of several elements of $S$, that is, there is ambiguity.
In any case of ambiguity, $*$ is **not well defined**.
If Condition 2 is violated, then $S$ is **not closed under** $*$.
