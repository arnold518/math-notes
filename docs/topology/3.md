# ยง 3. Relations

!!! definition "Definition 3.1 : Relation"
    A **relation** on a set $A$ is a subset $C$ of the cartesian product $A \times A$.

    If $C$ is a relation on $A$, we use the notation $x C y$ to mean the same thing as $(x, y) \in$ $C$. We read it **"$x$ is in the relation $C$ to $y$"**.

!!! definition "Definition 3.2 : Equivalence Relation"
    An **equivalence relation** on a set $A$ is a relation $\sim$ on $A$ having the following three properties:

    1. **(Reflexivity)** $x \sim x$ for every $x$ in $A$.
    2. **(Symmetry)** If $x \sim y$, then $y \sim x$.
    3. **(Transitivity)** If $x \sim y$ and $y \sim z$, then $x \sim z$.

!!! definition "Definition 3.3 : Equivalence Class"
    Given an equivalence relation $\sim$ on a set $A$ and an element $x$ of $A$, we define a certain subset $E$ of $A$, called the **equivalence class** determined by $x$, by the equation

    $$
    E=\{y \mid y \sim x\} .
    $$

!!! theorem "Lemma 3.1"
    Two equivalence classes $E$ and $E^{\prime}$ are either disjoint or equal.

    !!! proof
        Let $E$ be the equivalence class determined by $x$, and let $E^{\prime}$ be the equivalence class determined by $x^{\prime}$. Suppose that $E \cap E^{\prime}$ is not empty; let $y$ be a point of $E \cap E^{\prime}$. We show that $E=E^{\prime}$.

        By definition, we have $y \sim x$ and $y \sim x^{\prime}$. Symmetry allows us to conclude that $x \sim y$ and $y \sim x^{\prime}$; from transitivity it follows that $x \sim x^{\prime}$. If now $w$ is any point of $E$, we have $w \sim x$ by definition; it follows from another application of transitivity that $w \sim x^{\prime}$. We conclude that $E \subset E^{\prime}$.

        The symmetry of the situation allows us to conclude that $E^{\prime} \subset E$ as well, so that $E=E^{\prime}$.

!!! definition "Definition 3.4 : Partition"
    A **partition** of a set $A$ is a collection of disjoint nonempty subsets of $A$ whose union is all of $A$.

!!! theorem "Theorem 3.2"
    Given any partition $\mathcal{D}$ of $A$, there is exactly one equivalence relation on $A$ from which it is derived.
    
    !!! proof
        To show that the partition $\mathcal{D}$ comes from some equivalence relation, let us define a relation $C$ on $A$ by setting $x C y$ if $x$ and $y$ belong to the same element of $\mathcal{D}$.
        Symmetry of $C$ is obvious; reflexivity follows from the fact that the union of the elements of $\mathcal{D}$ equals all of $A$; transitivity follows from the fact that distinct elements of $\mathcal{D}$ are disjoint.
        It is simple to check that the collection of equivalence classes determined by $C$ is precisely the collection $\mathcal{D}$.

        To show there is only one such equivalence relation, suppose that $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$ are two equivalence relations on $A$ that give rise to the same collection of equivalence classes $\mathcal{D}$.
        Given $x \in A$, we show that $y C_{1} x$ if and only if $y C_{2} x$, from which we conclude that $C_{1}=C_{2}$.
        Let $E_{1}$ be the equivalence class determined by $x$ relative to the relation $C_{1}$; let $E_{2}$ be the equivalence class determined by $x$ relative to the relation $C_{2}$.
        Then $E_{1}$ is an element of $\mathcal{D}$, so that it must equal the unique element $D$ of $\mathcal{D}$ that contains $x$. Similarly, $E_{2}$ must equal $D$.
        Now by definition, $E_{1}$ consists of all $y$ such that $y C_{1} x$; and $E_{2}$ consists of all $y$ such that $y C_{2} x$. Since $E_{1}=D=E_{2}$, our result is proved.

!!! definition "Definition 3.5 : Order Relation"
    A relation $<$ on a set $A$ is called an **order relation** (or a simple order, or a linear order) if it has the following properties:

    1. **(Comparability)** For every $x$ and $y$ in $A$ for which $x \neq y$, either $x < y$ or $y < x$.
    2. **(Nonreflexivity)** For no $x$ in $A$ does the relation $x < x$ hold.
    3. **(Transitivity)** If $x < y$ and $y < z$, then $x < z$.

    By (2) and (3), for some pair of elements $x$ and $y$ of $A$, only one of $x < y$ or $y < x$ hold.

    We shall use the notation $x \leq y$ to stand for the statement "either $x<y$ or $x=y$"; and we shall use the notation $y>x$ to stand for the statement "$x<y$.
    We write $x<y<z$ to mean "$x<y$ and $y<z$."

!!! definition "Definition 3.6 : Open Interval / Immediate Predecessor / Immediate Successor"
    If $X$ is a set and $<$ is an order relation on $X$, and if $a<b$, we use the notation $(a, b)$ to denote the set

    $$
    \{x \mid a<x<b\}
    $$

    it is called an **open interval** in $X$.

    If this set is empty, we call $a$ the **immediate predecessor** of $b$, and we call $b$ the **immediate successor** of $a$.

!!! definition "Definition 3.7 : Order Type"
    Suppose that $A$ and $B$ are two sets with order relations $<_{A}$ and $<_{B}$ respectively.
    We say that $A$ and $B$ have the same **order type** if there is a bijective correspondence between them that preserves order; that is, if there exists a bijective function $f: A \rightarrow B$ such that

    $$
    a_{1}<_{A} a_{2} \Longrightarrow f\left(a_{1}\right)<_{B} f\left(a_{2}\right) .
    $$

!!! definition "Definition 3.8 : Dictionary Order Relation"
    Suppose that $A$ and $B$ are two sets with order relations $<_{A}$ and $<_{B}$ respectively.
    Define an order relation $<$ on $A \times B$ by defining

    $$
    a_{1} \times b_{1}<a_{2} \times b_{2}
    $$

    if $a_{1}<_{A} a_{2}$, or if $a_{1}=a_{2}$ and $b_{1}<_{B} b_{2}$.
    It is called the **dictionary order relation** on $A \times B$.

!!! definition "Definition 3.9 : Largest Element / Smallest Element"
    Suppose that $A$ is a set ordered by the relation $<$.
    Let $A_{0}$ be a subset of $A$.
    We say that the element $b$ is the **largest element** of $A_{0}$ if $b \in A_{0}$ and if $x \leq b$ for every $x \in A_{0}$.

    Similarly, we say that $a$ is the **smallest element** of $A_{0}$ if $a \in A_{0}$ and if $a \leq x$ for every $x \in A_{0}$.
    
    It is easy to see that a set has at most one largest element and at most one smallest element.

!!! definition "Definition 3.10 : Bounded Above / Upper Bound / Supremum (Least Upper Bound)"
    Suppose that $A$ is a set ordered by the relation $<$.
    Let $A_{0}$ be a subset of $A$.

    We say that the subset $A_{0}$ of $A$ is **bounded above** if there is an element $b$ of $A$ such that $x \leq b$ for every $x \in A_{0}$; the element $b$ is called an **upper bound** for $A_{0}$.

    If the set of all upper bounds for $A_{0}$ has a smallest element, that element is called the **least upper bound**, or the **supremum**, of $A_{0}$.
    It is denoted by $\sup A_{0}$; it may or may not belong to $A_{0}$. If it does, it is the largest element of $A_{0}$.

!!! definition "Definition 3.11 : Bounded Below / Lower Bound / Infimum (Greatest Lower Bound)"
    Suppose that $A$ is a set ordered by the relation $<$.
    Let $A_{0}$ be a subset of $A$.

    We say that the subset $A_{0}$ of $A$ is **bounded below** if there is an element $a$ of $A$ such that $a \leq x$ for every $x \in A_{0}$; the element $a$ is called an **lower bound** for $A_{0}$.

    If the set of all lower bounds for $A_{0}$ has a largest element, that element is called the **greatest lower bound**, or the **infimum**, of $A_{0}$.
    It is denoted by $\inf A_{0}$; it may or may not belong to $A_{0}$. If it does, it is the smallest element of $A_{0}$.

!!! definition "Definition 3.12 : Least Upper Bound Property / Greatest Lower Bound Property"
    An ordered set $A$ is said to have the **least upper bound property** if every nonempty subset $A_{0}$ of $A$ that is bounded above has a least upper bound.
    
    Analogously, the set $A$ is said to have the **greatest lower bound property** if every nonempty subset $A_{0}$ of $A$ that is bounded below has a greatest lower bound.
